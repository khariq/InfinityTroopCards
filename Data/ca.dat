Distance Modifiers for marking with Forward Observer are applied as per the following table: There are two types of attacks that can be made as a result of the marking by a Forward Observer:   Speculative: When the Forward Observer passes his WIP Roll, the target remains marked for any other comrade that wants to shoot at that target, and the Speculative Fire Modifier is not applied.   Guided: When the Forward Observer passes his WIP Roll the target will remain marked for any other comrade possessing a weapon with Guided Ammunition. This figure will be able to use the Short Skill Ballistic Skills to hit the marked miniature without a roll required, as the WIP Roll of the Observer substitutes.

If he passes the roll, the patient recovers 1 Wound, automatically leaving the Unconscious state and contributing his Order again to the Orders Reserve of his army in the next active turn. With a MediKit, miniatures can be healed from the Unconscious state as many times as necessary, provided they pass their PH-3 Rolls. Human MediKits do not work on Aliens (Assault Packs, Dog-Warriors, etc.) and vice versa. The MediKit is the most frequent medical system of nano-injection on battlefields. There are several syringe models; the most modern being a device with the form of a gun, using a chamber with a magnetic coil. After introducing the nanotreatment cartridge and pulling the electric trigger, the magnetic field accelerator injects at high speed the medical nanobots suspended in the cartridge serum.

The active player can deploy a miniature with AD: Combat Jump at any point during the battle. The figure spends 1 Order (His own, not one from the Orders Reserve) and makes a PH Normal Roll. If successful he deploys to any point on the table nominated by his owner, facing in any direction desired. Dispersion: If he fails the PH roll, the miniature suffers a detour in his fall, deviating as many inches as the Failure Category multiplied by 2.5 (FC x 2.5). In order to determine in which direction the miniature deviates, a Circular Template is used. Place the Circular Template on the target point where the miniature was supposed to land, with the number 1 facing towards the centre of the table. The second digit of the dice Roll is used indicate the direction in which the miniature deviate. If deviation prompts the figure to fall outside the battlefield, he will have to spend an extra Order from the Order Reserve to appear on the border of the game table at the point where he would have left. A figure cannot nominate as jump target the interior of a Smoke zone, or in Impassable Terrain or Zones of Low or Zero Visibility. The landing zone is of the same size as a Circular Template and must be free of scenery elements. The figure with Combat Jump can land on any point in the landing zone but the whole of its base must be in the interior of the Circular Template. A figure cannot land in base to base contact with another miniature. If a Coordinated Order is used to perform a Combat Jump, all the miniatures participating must choose the same template as their landing point. Those failing their PH Roll will be dispersed individually. Figures possessing Combat Jump can also deploy themselves, if they wish to, as if they possessed the preceding levels in AD.  Remotes with Combat Jump will have to perform a PH Roll in order to jump. PH determines the automation and programming level of their jumps.  Impetuous Figures with Combat Jump will have to use their Impetuous Order to perform their jump. If they do not want to jump immediately, at the beginning of the turn they must spend an Order from their army's Orders Reserve in order to stop each impetuous figure from deploying with their Impetuous Order.	 Exrah	Concordat Exrah Operators are the ephemeral branch of the Exrah race. Their keratinous epidermis is softer, which allows them more mobility and personal speed, but makes them vulnerable to radiation, so their life expectancy is very short. Physical damage suffered by the Ephemeral is impossible to cure, as his internal organs, affected by the ambient radiation of their planet and cosmic rays received in their trips, have a very short endurance. Because of this, when an Exrah receives a hit that pierces his ARM, his state directly moves to Dead: he does not suffer the Unconscious state and is automatically removed from the battlefield. Furthermore, the organism of the Exrah is very sensitive to powerful E/M transmitters, which causes them severe internal damage. If an Exrah receives an E/M impact and fails his BTS Roll, he will pass directly to the Dead state and is removed from the game table. Ephemeral Exrah have a superior capacity of movement than would be assumed given their massive aspect: they move better than any other Medium Infantry. They also have short wings, which is powered by their combat keratin and allows them to move in great leaps, conferring the Super Jump Special Skill.  	 Super-Jump	These miniatures are genetically, artificially, or evolutionarily designed to perform jumps of astonishing length and height. This Special Skill works automatically. It allows the miniature to move in a vertical, diagonal, or horizontal jump as many inches as indicated in his MOV, without having to make a PH Roll. Super-Jump is a Special Short Movement Skill that can be combined with other Short Skills. For example, with Super-Jump, the figure can shoot while flying through the air and this will be considered an Order of the Move+BS type. Also, when the miniature moves in a normal way he will be able to avoid any obstacle of his height or less without any Movement restriction. To calculate the Falling Damage taken by miniatures with SuperJump, the sum of both values of his MOV Attribute is subtracted from the distance and the result multiplied by 2.5. For example: a miniature with Super-Jump with MOV 4-4, that jumps from a terrace to the floor from a height of 10 inches will only have to make an ARM Roll against Damage 5 (distance of 10 minus MOV 4+4 = 2, multiplied by 2.5 to give 5).  	 V: Courage	Courage avoids, without spending any Order, the WIP Roll that is compulsory after surviving the impact of a ballistic weapon but the figure does not wish to move to cover (The Guts Roll made after a successful ARM Roll).

The active player can deploy a miniature with AD: Combat Jump at any point during the battle. The figure spends 1 Order (His own, not one from the Orders Reserve) and makes a PH Normal Roll. If successful he deploys to any point on the table nominated by his owner, facing in any direction desired. Dispersion: If he fails the PH roll, the miniature suffers a detour in his fall, deviating as many inches as the Failure Category multiplied by 2.5 (FC x 2.5). In order to determine in which direction the miniature deviates, a Circular Template is used. Place the Circular Template on the target point where the miniature was supposed to land, with the number 1 facing towards the centre of the table. The second digit of the dice Roll is used indicate the direction in which the miniature deviate. If deviation prompts the figure to fall outside the battlefield, he will have to spend an extra Order from the Order Reserve to appear on the border of the game table at the point where he would have left. A figure cannot nominate as jump target the interior of a Smoke zone, or in Impassable Terrain or Zones of Low or Zero Visibility. The landing zone is of the same size as a Circular Template and must be free of scenery elements. The figure with Combat Jump can land on any point in the landing zone but the whole of its base must be in the interior of the Circular Template. A figure cannot land in base to base contact with another miniature. If a Coordinated Order is used to perform a Combat Jump, all the miniatures participating must choose the same template as their landing point. Those failing their PH Roll will be dispersed individually. Figures possessing Combat Jump can also deploy themselves, if they wish to, as if they possessed the preceding levels in AD.  Remotes with Combat Jump will have to perform a PH Roll in order to jump. PH determines the automation and programming level of their jumps.  Impetuous Figures with Combat Jump will have to use their Impetuous Order to perform their jump. If they do not want to jump immediately, at the beginning of the turn they must spend an Order from their army's Orders Reserve in order to stop each impetuous figure from deploying with their Impetuous Order.	 Exrah	Concordat Exrah Operators are the ephemeral branch of the Exrah race. Their keratinous epidermis is softer, which allows them more mobility and personal speed, but makes them vulnerable to radiation, so their life expectancy is very short. Physical damage suffered by the Ephemeral is impossible to cure, as his internal organs, affected by the ambient radiation of their planet and cosmic rays received in their trips, have a very short endurance. Because of this, when an Exrah receives a hit that pierces his ARM, his state directly moves to Dead: he does not suffer the Unconscious state and is automatically removed from the battlefield. Furthermore, the organism of the Exrah is very sensitive to powerful E/M transmitters, which causes them severe internal damage. If an Exrah receives an E/M impact and fails his BTS Roll, he will pass directly to the Dead state and is removed from the game table. Ephemeral Exrah have a superior capacity of movement than would be assumed given their massive aspect: they move better than any other Medium Infantry. They also have short wings, which is powered by their combat keratin and allows them to move in great leaps, conferring the Super Jump Special Skill.  	 Super-Jump	These miniatures are genetically, artificially, or evolutionarily designed to perform jumps of astonishing length and height. This Special Skill works automatically. It allows the miniature to move in a vertical, diagonal, or horizontal jump as many inches as indicated in his MOV, without having to make a PH Roll. Super-Jump is a Special Short Movement Skill that can be combined with other Short Skills. For example, with Super-Jump, the figure can shoot while flying through the air and this will be considered an Order of the Move+BS type. Also, when the miniature moves in a normal way he will be able to avoid any obstacle of his height or less without any Movement restriction.

A 360 Visor functions automatically and does not require the spending of an Order to be activated. It allows a LoF of 360, so the figure has no blind points and cannot be surprised from behind.  	 Exrah	Concordat Exrah Operators are the ephemeral branch of the Exrah race. Their keratinous epidermis is softer, which allows them more mobility and personal speed, but makes them vulnerable to radiation, so their life expectancy is very short. Physical damage suffered by the Ephemeral is impossible to cure, as his internal organs, affected by the ambient radiation of their planet and cosmic rays received in their trips, have a very short endurance. Because of this, when an Exrah receives a hit that pierces his ARM, his state directly moves to Dead: he does not suffer the Unconscious state and is automatically removed from the battlefield. Furthermore, the organism of the Exrah is very sensitive to powerful E/M transmitters, which causes them severe internal damage. If an Exrah receives an E/M impact and fails his BTS Roll, he will pass directly to the Dead state and is removed from the game table. Ephemeral Exrah have a superior capacity of movement than would be assumed given their massive aspect: they move better than any other Medium Infantry. They also have short wings, which is powered by their combat keratin and allows them to move in great leaps, conferring the Super Jump Special Skill.  	 Super-Jump	These miniatures are genetically, artificially, or evolutionarily designed to perform jumps of astonishing length and height. This Special Skill works automatically. It allows the miniature to move in a vertical, diagonal, or horizontal jump as many inches as indicated in his MOV, without having to make a PH Roll. Super-Jump is a Special Short Movement Skill that can be combined with other Short Skills. For example, with Super-Jump, the figure can shoot while flying through the air and this will be considered an Order of the Move+BS type. Also, when the miniature moves in a normal way he will be able to avoid any obstacle of his height or less without any Movement restriction. To calculate the Falling Damage taken by miniatures with SuperJump, the sum of both values of his MOV Attribute is subtracted from the distance and the result multiplied by 2.5. For example: a miniature with Super-Jump with MOV 4-4, that jumps from a terrace to the floor from a height of 10 inches will only have to make an ARM Roll against Damage 5 (distance of 10 minus MOV 4+4 = 2, multiplied by 2.5 to give 5).

This term encompasses all devices that vehicles and T.A.G.s use to avoid and neutralize incoming enemy guided projectiles. Standard ECM includes a system of fire detection, localization and proximity radars as well as small battery of micromissiles loaded with nanotechnological chaff. This equipment tampers with the systems of enemy guided projectiles, forcing them to deviate from their target and to explode out of range. ECM from Ariadna are similar to modern ones, although comparatively bigger. Instead of nanotech micromissiles, their ECM systems are equipped with a battery of rockets that create a wall of explosions that detonate enemy guided projectiles. ECM has a standard level of 5, requiring a Normal Roll of 5 or less for each incoming guided projectiles to deflect and detonate the projectile without causing any damage. ECM functions automatically and does not require spending of any Orders or having LoF and can be used in ARO. ECM allows reacting in ARO against enemy guided projectiles.  	 Morat	The Morat are the militarist race par excellence. Morat troops possess an ingrained feeling of belonging to their combat units. Their instruction and training have produced an attack force where an individual sense of duty and personal honour is sublimated to those of the group. The Morat are very strict, follow rules to the letter and will fight until no soldier is on his feet: for this reason they will not disperse until they accomplish their mission.

Morat	The Morat are the militarist race par excellence. Morat troops possess an ingrained feeling of belonging to their combat units. Their instruction and training have produced an attack force where an individual sense of duty and personal honour is sublimated to those of the group. The Morat are very strict, follow rules to the letter and will fight until no soldier is on his feet: for this reason they will not disperse until they accomplish their mission.

The active player can deploy a miniature with AD: Combat Jump at any point during the battle. The figure spends 1 Order (His own, not one from the Orders Reserve) and makes a PH Normal Roll. If successful he deploys to any point on the table nominated by his owner, facing in any direction desired. Dispersion: If he fails the PH roll, the miniature suffers a detour in his fall, deviating as many inches as the Failure Category multiplied by 2.5 (FC x 2.5). In order to determine in which direction the miniature deviates, a Circular Template is used. Place the Circular Template on the target point where the miniature was supposed to land, with the number 1 facing towards the centre of the table. The second digit of the dice Roll is used indicate the direction in which the miniature deviate. If deviation prompts the figure to fall outside the battlefield, he will have to spend an extra Order from the Order Reserve to appear on the border of the game table at the point where he would have left. A figure cannot nominate as jump target the interior of a Smoke zone, or in Impassable Terrain or Zones of Low or Zero Visibility. The landing zone is of the same size as a Circular Template and must be free of scenery elements. The figure with Combat Jump can land on any point in the landing zone but the whole of its base must be in the interior of the Circular Template. A figure cannot land in base to base contact with another miniature. If a Coordinated Order is used to perform a Combat Jump, all the miniatures participating must choose the same template as their landing point. Those failing their PH Roll will be dispersed individually. Figures possessing Combat Jump can also deploy themselves, if they wish to, as if they possessed the preceding levels in AD.  Remotes with Combat Jump will have to perform a PH Roll in order to jump. PH determines the automation and programming level of their jumps.  Impetuous Figures with Combat Jump will have to use their Impetuous Order to perform their jump. If they do not want to jump immediately, at the beginning of the turn they must spend an Order from their army's Orders Reserve in order to stop each impetuous figure from deploying with their Impetuous Order.	 ECM	Electronic Countermeasures. This term encompasses all devices that vehicles and T.A.G.s use to avoid and neutralize incoming enemy guided projectiles. Standard ECM includes a system of fire detection, localization and proximity radars as well as small battery of micromissiles loaded with nanotechnological chaff. This equipment tampers with the systems of enemy guided projectiles, forcing them to deviate from their target and to explode out of range. ECM from Ariadna are similar to modern ones, although comparatively bigger. Instead of nanotech micromissiles, their ECM systems are equipped with a battery of rockets that create a wall of explosions that detonate enemy guided projectiles. ECM has a standard level of 5, requiring a Normal Roll of 5 or less for each incoming guided projectiles to deflect and detonate the projectile without causing any damage. ECM functions automatically and does not require spending of any Orders or having LoF and can be used in ARO. ECM allows reacting in ARO against enemy guided projectiles.  	 Explode	This Special Skill is used by a figure to explode after it falls into an Unconscious state. The area of explosion is that of a Circular Template, causing 13 Shock Damage to all in the area. The detonation caused by this Special Skill can be Dodged by passing a PH-6 Roll. Exploding is a Short Skill that allows the figure to explode at any moment he deems suitable, after passing a Normal WIP Roll. Activating this Special Skill will provoke a rapid death in its bearer. Exploding can be used in CC substituting the CC Attribute with WIP, the figure Exploding rather than causing a hit: this allows the figure to Explode without being Unconscious first. In the specific case of T.A.G.s with Combat Jump, such as the Caskuda, the explosion is only produced when hitting the ground: the figure will not suffer any damage and will not be able to explode again.  	 G: Remote Presence	Remote Presence: This Special Skill is possessed by Remotes and unmanned T.A.G.s. Remotes have pseudo-AIs and expert programs that rule their behaviour in combat, operating in pure logic where fear has no place. In the case of Remote Presence T.A.G.s, the driver is not physically present on the battlefield and remotely controls it from a safe distance. Remote Presence is considered confers the Valor: Courage Special Skill. Figures with Remote Presence cannot have a Cube.  	 				Heavy Flamethrower	MULTI HMG

The Aspect can also jump when his body is in an Unconscious state, but this will cause the body to automatically autodestruct and it must be removed from the game table. The Mnemonica Special Skill does not require the spending of an Order and functions automatically. Mnemonica allows the EI to continue acting as Lieutenant in his army with no Loss of Lieutenant situation incurred whilst there are figures where it can discharge itself. When activating Mnemonica in another figure of the Combined Army, he will acquire the original WIP of the EI's Aspect (16 or 17), and the Ghost: Mnemonica Special Skill, but he will not be able to make use of any other Special Skill owned by the original body of the Aspect, or his equipment such as Sepsitor, Multispectral Visor, TO Camouflage, etc. Ghost: Mnemonica includes too the Ghost: Remote Presence Special Skill.

During Deployment, figures possessing this Special Skill can place inside their ZC a Camo Marker which represents a camouflaged Mine, or a Marker representing the deployable weapon with which he is equipped (E/Mauler, Deployable Repeater). It may not be placed if any enemy troop is inside the area of effect of the deployable weapon. If the figure deploys using the Infiltration Special Skill and fails the PH roll, then a Mine Marker will be placed instead of a Camouflage marker. The Minelayer Special Skill is automatic and it does not require the spending of any Orders or the making of any rolls. The deployed weapon or equipment must be deducted from those carried by the figure.	 AutoMediKit	This is a nano-medical device that some troops have integrated to their personal tactical equipment. It injects nanorepairers automatically in their systems allowing them to recover from the Unconscious state. It requires the spending of 1 Complete Order and the passing of a PH roll. If the roll is successful, the figure recovers from 1 Wound automatically, leaving the Unconscious state and adding his Order to his army's Orders Reserve as usual in the next active turn. If the figure fails his roll, he will automatically pass to the Dead state and will have to be removed from the battlefield. With an AutoMediKit, miniatures can recover from the Unconscious state as many times as necessary, provided that they pass their PH roll each time. The AutoMediKit is a sophisticated device, a product of the highest technology, but it can be affected by E/M weapons. If it suffers from E/M damage an AutoMediKit will be Disabled  	 CH: Camouflage	The miniature has a special capacity, be it natural or learned, for hiding and stealth. He will also have chameleonic tools available: photoreactive cells and variable/ combinable environment patterns. These clothing-incorporated systems will merge the miniature with his surroundings. The Special Skill of Camouflage allows its owner to perform:   Camouflaged Deployment: This use is exclusive to the deployment phase and does not require the spending of any Orders or making of rolls. The miniature is not deployed in the usual way: a Camouflage Marker is placed instead. This type of Deployment also allows 3 miniatures (All with the Special Skill of Camouflage) to be deployed under the same Marker. One or more miniatures can be separated from the group at any point in the game, moving as a separate Camouflage Marker. All the figures placed under the Camouflage Marker are revealed if the adversary makes a successful Discover Roll, or if some of the figures perform an Order that uncovers them. When revealed, figures must appear no more than inch of distance from each other, although the player can place them facing however he likes. In game terms, a Camouflage Marker is always the same height as a base troop figure from its own army (Unless it has a Prone Marker beside it).   Camouflage in Movement: This allows the player to move the miniature without placing him on the battlefield. Only his Camouflage Marker will move. When several miniatures are moved under the same Camouflage Marker, they behave as if they were only one miniature. If they have different MOV values, the lowest is always used. The only Skills whose execution does not automatically rreveal the camouflaged figures are Cautious Movement and all Short Skills of Movement that do not require any roll (except Alert). The camouflaged figure reveals automatically when it is in base contact with another figure. If the figure is Discovered or is automatically revealed, the Camouflage Marker is replaced by its miniature (or miniatures), facing how the player prefers. If a Camouflage Marker does not perform anything but MOV in his turn, even if it crosses a Suppression Fire zone or a figure's ZC, the only ARO that can be executed against it is Discover or Change Facing.   Defensive Camouflage: To act against a Camouflage Marker, enemies must succeed in a Discover roll with a -3 Modifier. If the roll is failed, the camouflaged figure is not perceived and may not be a target of BS, CC, or any other Skill (Hacking, Sepsitor, etc.). If the Camouflaged miniature (Or miniatures, if they are clustered) is discovered, it will have to be placed on the battlefield, substituting the Camouflage Maker and losing all the advantages of Camouflage in Movement and Combat, but still complicating any BS Roll against him with a Modifier of -3. When placing the figure over terrain, he can face any direction his owner chooses.   Combat Camouflage: This allows a miniature in a camouflaged state to make a BS, Forward Observer, Sepsitor or Hacking attack before his opponent does. This attack is made with a Normal Roll. If the adversary survives the attack, he may then make any attacks he may have declared in ARO which are also made as Normal Rolls, with -3 to BS if shooting at the revealed figure. After this, the player will have to replace the Camouflage Marker with the correct figure. Combat Camouflage is only available for use with Ballistic Skills. In ARO, the reactions of Camouflaged soldiers are simultaneous to the Order they react to, so Face to Face Rolls will be made. If the Camouflaged figure receives an Intuitive Attack without having been Discovered first, he will have to reveal himself even if he passes the ARM Roll, removing the Camouflage Marker and placing the real figure. In the same way, if he is affected by a Template but the target was another figure, he will have to make an ARM Roll, revealing himself whether he passes the roll or not.   Camouflaging Again: When a figure has lost the Camouflaged status (It is represented by its figure and not a Camouflage Marker), he can recover his former status by spending 1 Order, provided that he is not in the LoF of any enemy miniatures. A figure in TO Camouflage in LoF of a miniature that intends to Camouflage itself again will have to reveal himself if he desires to prevent his enemy from re-entering Camouflaged status.	 Infiltration	Due to his ability to move stealthily, the miniature will be able to infiltrate the enemy's lines without being noticed. The use of the Infiltrate Special Skill is only allowed in the Deployment Phase. Infiltration allows a miniature the following options:   Option A: The miniature can be deployed, without having to spend an Order or make a Roll, up to the central area of the game table (within the half corresponding to his army). He is deployed in Camouflage or TO Camouflage status if applicable.   Option B: If the miniature wants to go further into enemy territory, he must to pass a Normal Roll of PH. Each 4 inch strip of distance advanced into enemy territory will add a cumulative Modifier of -1 to the roll. If he fails the roll, the Dispersion rule must now be applied. The centre of the Circular Template must be placed at the point in the battlefield where the figure wished to Infiltrate, with the number 1 pointing to the centre of the game table, multiplying the Failure Category by 2.5 (FC x 2.5) to determine where to place the infiltrator. Moreover, the miniature will lose the Camouflaged Deployment and Hidden Deployment options provided by the CH: Camouflage and CH: TO Camouflage Special Skills.   It is not allowed to Infiltrate inside the enemy's Zone of Deployment, or in base contact with another figure. If Dispersion would place the miniature in either position, move the figure back towards its initial Infiltration point until it is no longer in an illegal position; ie. the figure will be placed on the limit of the enemy's Zone of Deployment closest to the initial Infiltration point.  	 Shasvastii	The Shavastii are an alien race with a completely different biology to humans. Endowed with a strong survival instinct, all the Shasvastii are partially hermaphroditic, allowing them to bear a fast growth Spawn-Embryo inside them that they will later implant in enemy territory. After some time, a Shasvastii will sprout from the Spawn-Embryo, which will follow genetically codified information to continue the mission of the Shasvastii Continuum. Spawn-Embryos can feed from the corpse of the fallen Shasvastii, so it is considered that no Shasvastii troop yields Victory Points to his enemy until his Spawn-Embryo has been wiped out. It is therefore considered that, to count VP for victory as for Retreat! Shasvastii have three levels: Unconscious, Dead, and Spawn. When the Shasvastii is Dead, replace it with a Spawn-Embryo Marker (SPAWNEMBRYO). The Spawn-Embryo cannot move from its location, attack, or defend itself. It has ARM 0, BTS 0 and if it suffers one Wound it must be removed from the battlefield.  	 		Combi Rifle	Antipersonnel Mines	Knife	Pistol

The Special Skill of Camouflage allows its owner to perform:   Camouflaged Deployment: This use is exclusive to the deployment phase and does not require the spending of any Orders or making of rolls. The miniature is not deployed in the usual way: a Camouflage Marker is placed instead. This type of Deployment also allows 3 miniatures (All with the Special Skill of Camouflage) to be deployed under the same Marker. One or more miniatures can be separated from the group at any point in the game, moving as a separate Camouflage Marker. All the figures placed under the Camouflage Marker are revealed if the adversary makes a successful Discover Roll, or if some of the figures perform an Order that uncovers them.

The camouflaged figure reveals automatically when it is in base contact with another figure. If the figure is Discovered or is automatically revealed, the Camouflage Marker is replaced by its miniature (or miniatures), facing how the player prefers. If a Camouflage Marker does not perform anything but MOV in his turn, even if it crosses a Suppression Fire zone or a figure's ZC, the only ARO that can be executed against it is Discover or Change Facing.   Defensive Camouflage: To act against a Camouflage Marker, enemies must succeed in a Discover roll with a -3 Modifier. If the roll is failed, the camouflaged figure is not perceived and may not be a target of BS, CC, or any other Skill (Hacking, Sepsitor, etc.). If the Camouflaged miniature (Or miniatures, if they are clustered) is discovered, it will have to be placed on the battlefield, substituting the Camouflage Maker and losing all the advantages of Camouflage in Movement and Combat, but still complicating any BS Roll against him with a Modifier of -3.

In the same way, if he is affected by a Template but the target was another figure, he will have to make an ARM Roll, revealing himself whether he passes the roll or not.   Camouflaging Again: When a figure has lost the Camouflaged status (It is represented by its figure and not a Camouflage Marker), he can recover his former status by spending 1 Order, provided that he is not in the LoF of any enemy miniatures. A figure in TO Camouflage in LoF of a miniature that intends to Camouflage itself again will have to reveal himself if he desires to prevent his enemy from re-entering Camouflaged status.

In the same way, if he is affected by a Template but the target was another figure, he will have to make an ARM Roll, revealing himself whether he passes the roll or not.   Camouflaging Again: When a figure has lost the Camouflaged status (It is represented by its figure and not a Camouflage Marker), he can recover his former status by spending 1 Order, provided that he is not in the LoF of any enemy miniatures. A figure in TO Camouflage in LoF of a miniature that intends to Camouflage itself again will have to reveal himself if he desires to prevent his enemy from re-entering Camouflaged status.	 Infiltration	Due to his ability to move stealthily, the miniature will be able to infiltrate the enemy's lines without being noticed. The use of the Infiltrate Special Skill is only allowed in the Deployment Phase. Infiltration allows a miniature the following options:   Option A: The miniature can be deployed, without having to spend an Order or make a Roll, up to the central area of the game table (within the half corresponding to his army). He is deployed in Camouflage or TO Camouflage status if applicable.   Option B: If the miniature wants to go further into enemy territory, he must to pass a Normal Roll of PH. Each 4 inch strip of distance advanced into enemy territory will add a cumulative Modifier of -1 to the roll. If he fails the roll, the Dispersion rule must now be applied. The centre of the Circular Template must be placed at the point in the battlefield where the figure wished to Infiltrate, with the number 1 pointing to the centre of the game table, multiplying the Failure Category by 2.5 (FC x 2.5) to determine where to place the infiltrator. Moreover, the miniature will lose the Camouflaged Deployment and Hidden Deployment options provided by the CH: Camouflage and CH: TO Camouflage Special Skills.   It is not allowed to Infiltrate inside the enemy's Zone of Deployment, or in base contact with another figure. If Dispersion would place the miniature in either position, move the figure back towards its initial Infiltration point until it is no longer in an illegal position; ie. the figure will be placed on the limit of the enemy's Zone of Deployment closest to the initial Infiltration point.  	 Shasvastii	The Shavastii are an alien race with a completely different biology to humans. Endowed with a strong survival instinct, all the Shasvastii are partially hermaphroditic, allowing them to bear a fast growth Spawn-Embryo inside them that they will later implant in enemy territory. After some time, a Shasvastii will sprout from the Spawn-Embryo, which will follow genetically codified information to continue the mission of the Shasvastii Continuum. Spawn-Embryos can feed from the corpse of the fallen Shasvastii, so it is considered that no Shasvastii troop yields Victory Points to his enemy until his Spawn-Embryo has been wiped out. It is therefore considered that, to count VP for victory as for Retreat! Shasvastii have three levels: Unconscious, Dead, and Spawn. When the Shasvastii is Dead, replace it with a Spawn-Embryo Marker (SPAWNEMBRYO). The Spawn-Embryo cannot move from its location, attack, or defend itself. It has ARM 0, BTS 0 and if it suffers one Wound it must be removed from the battlefield.  	Combi Rifle	Antipersonnel Mines	Knife	Pistol

A Forward Observer in LoF with an enemy will be able to mark him after passing a WIP roll (Face to Face, or Normal, depending on the case), modified by Covers, Distance, Camouflage and Hiding Special Skill, or an Optical Disruptor Device. Distance Modifiers for marking with Forward Observer are applied as per the following table: There are two types of attacks that can be made as a result of the marking by a Forward Observer:   Speculative: When the Forward Observer passes his WIP Roll, the target remains marked for any other comrade that wants to shoot at that target, and the Speculative Fire Modifier is not applied.   Guided: When the Forward Observer passes his WIP Roll the target will remain marked for any other comrade possessing a weapon with Guided Ammunition. This figure will be able to use the Short Skill Ballistic Skills to hit the marked miniature without a roll required, as the WIP Roll of the Observer substitutes.   A miniature marked by a Forward Observer will be considered as marked until the end of the turn of the player possessing the Observer that marked it. The special equipment of Forward Observers allows them to use the Flash Pulse.  	 AutoMediKit	This is a nano-medical device that some troops have integrated to their personal tactical equipment. It injects nanorepairers automatically in their systems allowing them to recover from the Unconscious state. It requires the spending of 1 Complete Order and the passing of a PH roll. If the roll is successful, the figure recovers from 1 Wound automatically, leaving the Unconscious state and adding his Order to his army's Orders Reserve as usual in the next active turn. If the figure fails his roll, he will automatically pass to the Dead state and will have to be removed from the battlefield. With an AutoMediKit, miniatures can recover from the Unconscious state as many times as necessary, provided that they pass their PH roll each time. The AutoMediKit is a sophisticated device, a product of the highest technology, but it can be affected by E/M weapons. If it suffers from E/M damage an AutoMediKit will be Disabled  	 CH: Camouflage	The miniature has a special capacity, be it natural or learned, for hiding and stealth. He will also have chameleonic tools available: photoreactive cells and variable/ combinable environment patterns. These clothing-incorporated systems will merge the miniature with his surroundings. The Special Skill of Camouflage allows its owner to perform:   Camouflaged Deployment: This use is exclusive to the deployment phase and does not require the spending of any Orders or making of rolls. The miniature is not deployed in the usual way: a Camouflage Marker is placed instead. This type of Deployment also allows 3 miniatures (All with the Special Skill of Camouflage) to be deployed under the same Marker. One or more miniatures can be separated from the group at any point in the game, moving as a separate Camouflage Marker. All the figures placed under the Camouflage Marker are revealed if the adversary makes a successful Discover Roll, or if some of the figures perform an Order that uncovers them. When revealed, figures must appear no more than inch of distance from each other, although the player can place them facing however he likes. In game terms, a Camouflage Marker is always the same height as a base troop figure from its own army (Unless it has a Prone Marker beside it).   Camouflage in Movement: This allows the player to move the miniature without placing him on the battlefield. Only his Camouflage Marker will move. When several miniatures are moved under the same Camouflage Marker, they behave as if they were only one miniature. If they have different MOV values, the lowest is always used. The only Skills whose execution does not automatically rreveal the camouflaged figures are Cautious Movement and all Short Skills of Movement that do not require any roll (except Alert). The camouflaged figure reveals automatically when it is in base contact with another figure. If the figure is Discovered or is automatically revealed, the Camouflage Marker is replaced by its miniature (or miniatures), facing how the player prefers. If a Camouflage Marker does not perform anything but MOV in his turn, even if it crosses a Suppression Fire zone or a figure's ZC, the only ARO that can be executed against it is Discover or Change Facing.   Defensive Camouflage: To act against a Camouflage Marker, enemies must succeed in a Discover roll with a -3 Modifier. If the roll is failed, the camouflaged figure is not perceived and may not be a target of BS, CC, or any other Skill (Hacking, Sepsitor, etc.). If the Camouflaged miniature (Or miniatures, if they are clustered) is discovered, it will have to be placed on the battlefield, substituting the Camouflage Maker and losing all the advantages of Camouflage in Movement and Combat, but still complicating any BS Roll against him with a Modifier of -3. When placing the figure over terrain, he can face any direction his owner chooses.   Combat Camouflage: This allows a miniature in a camouflaged state to make a BS, Forward Observer, Sepsitor or Hacking attack before his opponent does. This attack is made with a Normal Roll. If the adversary survives the attack, he may then make any attacks he may have declared in ARO which are also made as Normal Rolls, with -3 to BS if shooting at the revealed figure. After this, the player will have to replace the Camouflage Marker with the correct figure. Combat Camouflage is only available for use with Ballistic Skills. In ARO, the reactions of Camouflaged soldiers are simultaneous to the Order they react to, so Face to Face Rolls will be made. If the Camouflaged figure receives an Intuitive Attack without having been Discovered first, he will have to reveal himself even if he passes the ARM Roll, removing the Camouflage Marker and placing the real figure. In the same way, if he is affected by a Template but the target was another figure, he will have to make an ARM Roll, revealing himself whether he passes the roll or not.   Camouflaging Again: When a figure has lost the Camouflaged status (It is represented by its figure and not a Camouflage Marker), he can recover his former status by spending 1 Order, provided that he is not in the LoF of any enemy miniatures. A figure in TO Camouflage in LoF of a miniature that intends to Camouflage itself again will have to reveal himself if he desires to prevent his enemy from re-entering Camouflaged status.	 Infiltration	Due to his ability to move stealthily, the miniature will be able to infiltrate the enemy's lines without being noticed. The use of the Infiltrate Special Skill is only allowed in the Deployment Phase. Infiltration allows a miniature the following options:   Option A: The miniature can be deployed, without having to spend an Order or make a Roll, up to the central area of the game table (within the half corresponding to his army). He is deployed in Camouflage or TO Camouflage status if applicable.   Option B: If the miniature wants to go further into enemy territory, he must to pass a Normal Roll of PH. Each 4 inch strip of distance advanced into enemy territory will add a cumulative Modifier of -1 to the roll. If he fails the roll, the Dispersion rule must now be applied. The centre of the Circular Template must be placed at the point in the battlefield where the figure wished to Infiltrate, with the number 1 pointing to the centre of the game table, multiplying the Failure Category by 2.5 (FC x 2.5) to determine where to place the infiltrator. Moreover, the miniature will lose the Camouflaged Deployment and Hidden Deployment options provided by the CH: Camouflage and CH: TO Camouflage Special Skills.   It is not allowed to Infiltrate inside the enemy's Zone of Deployment, or in base contact with another figure. If Dispersion would place the miniature in either position, move the figure back towards its initial Infiltration point until it is no longer in an illegal position; ie. the figure will be placed on the limit of the enemy's Zone of Deployment closest to the initial Infiltration point.  	 Shasvastii	The Shavastii are an alien race with a completely different biology to humans. Endowed with a strong survival instinct, all the Shasvastii are partially hermaphroditic, allowing them to bear a fast growth Spawn-Embryo inside them that they will later implant in enemy territory. After some time, a Shasvastii will sprout from the Spawn-Embryo, which will follow genetically codified information to continue the mission of the Shasvastii Continuum. Spawn-Embryos can feed from the corpse of the fallen Shasvastii, so it is considered that no Shasvastii troop yields Victory Points to his enemy until his Spawn-Embryo has been wiped out. It is therefore considered that, to count VP for victory as for Retreat! Shasvastii have three levels: Unconscious, Dead, and Spawn. When the Shasvastii is Dead, replace it with a Spawn-Embryo Marker (SPAWNEMBRYO). The Spawn-Embryo cannot move from its location, attack, or defend itself.

This is a system that curves the light around its bearer, rendering him almost invisible and erasing his thermal signature. This sophisticated device also diffuses any possible atmospheric turbulence that its bearer may provoke and prevents his detection by radar or sonar. In game terms, TO Camouflage allows its possessor to perform the following:   Hidden Deployment: It allows the same type of deployment as CH: L-2 Camouflage, but there is no need to make use of a Marker. Provided that he does not move, the figure with CH: TO Camouflage will remain completely invisible. The player must take note of his figure's position in the most detailed possible way (Cover, Prone, etc.) so that the adversary will be able to verify the data in the moment in which he reveals his position. If the miniature moves, the player must place a TO Camouflage Marker, and show his adversary that he really was in that position from the beginning of the battle. If the figure performs any other action, he will have to be replaced by the miniature instead of the Marker. A miniature in Hidden Deployment does not add his Order to the Orders Reserve, as he is not on the game table. However, to carry out his first Order, which reveals his presence on the battlefield, he will not receive the Order from the Orders Reserve but will have to spend his own.   Camouflage in Movement: Allows the miniature to carry out the same Camouflaged Movement allowed by CH: Camouflage.   TO Defensive Camouflage: Allows the miniature the same Defensive Camouflage that CH: Camouflage provides, but a negative Modifier of -6 is applied if someone intends to attack him.

If it suffers from E/M damage an AutoMediKit will be Disabled  	 CH: TO Camouflage	The miniature possesses, besides the Special Skill Camouflage, a Thermo-Optical mimetizing device. This is a system that curves the light around its bearer, rendering him almost invisible and erasing his thermal signature. This sophisticated device also diffuses any possible atmospheric turbulence that its bearer may provoke and prevents his detection by radar or sonar. In game terms, TO Camouflage allows its possessor to perform the following:   Hidden Deployment: It allows the same type of deployment as CH: L-2 Camouflage, but there is no need to make use of a Marker. Provided that he does not move, the figure with CH: TO Camouflage will remain completely invisible. The player must take note of his figure's position in the most detailed possible way (Cover, Prone, etc.) so that the adversary will be able to verify the data in the moment in which he reveals his position. If the miniature moves, the player must place a TO Camouflage Marker, and show his adversary that he really was in that position from the beginning of the battle. If the figure performs any other action, he will have to be replaced by the miniature instead of the Marker. A miniature in Hidden Deployment does not add his Order to the Orders Reserve, as he is not on the game table. However, to carry out his first Order, which reveals his presence on the battlefield, he will not receive the Order from the Orders Reserve but will have to spend his own.   Camouflage in Movement: Allows the miniature to carry out the same Camouflaged Movement allowed by CH: Camouflage.   TO Defensive Camouflage: Allows the miniature the same Defensive Camouflage that CH: Camouflage provides, but a negative Modifier of -6 is applied if someone intends to attack him.   TO Combat Camouflage: Allows the same Combat Camouflage as CH: L-2 Camouflage, with no orders needing to be spent.   Camouflaging again: Functions exactly as CH: L-2 Camouflage	 Infiltration	Due to his ability to move stealthily, the miniature will be able to infiltrate the enemy's lines without being noticed. The use of the Infiltrate Special Skill is only allowed in the Deployment Phase. Infiltration allows a miniature the following options:   Option A: The miniature can be deployed, without having to spend an Order or make a Roll, up to the central area of the game table (within the half corresponding to his army). He is deployed in Camouflage or TO Camouflage status if applicable.   Option B: If the miniature wants to go further into enemy territory, he must to pass a Normal Roll of PH. Each 4 inch strip of distance advanced into enemy territory will add a cumulative Modifier of -1 to the roll. If he fails the roll, the Dispersion rule must now be applied. The centre of the Circular Template must be placed at the point in the battlefield where the figure wished to Infiltrate, with the number 1 pointing to the centre of the game table, multiplying the Failure Category by 2.5 (FC x 2.5) to determine where to place the infiltrator. Moreover, the miniature will lose the Camouflaged Deployment and Hidden Deployment options provided by the CH: Camouflage and CH: TO Camouflage Special Skills.   It is not allowed to Infiltrate inside the enemy's Zone of Deployment, or in base contact with another figure. If Dispersion would place the miniature in either position, move the figure back towards its initial Infiltration point until it is no longer in an illegal position; ie. the figure will be placed on the limit of the enemy's Zone of Deployment closest to the initial Infiltration point.  	 Shasvastii	The Shavastii are an alien race with a completely different biology to humans. Endowed with a strong survival instinct, all the Shasvastii are partially hermaphroditic, allowing them to bear a fast growth Spawn-Embryo inside them that they will later implant in enemy territory. After some time, a Shasvastii will sprout from the Spawn-Embryo, which will follow genetically codified information to continue the mission of the Shasvastii Continuum. Spawn-Embryos can feed from the corpse of the fallen Shasvastii, so it is considered that no Shasvastii troop yields Victory Points to his enemy until his Spawn-Embryo has been wiped out. It is therefore considered that, to count VP for victory as for Retreat! Shasvastii have three levels: Unconscious, Dead, and Spawn. When the Shasvastii is Dead, replace it with a Spawn-Embryo Marker (SPAWNEMBRYO). The Spawn-Embryo cannot move from its location, attack, or defend itself. It has ARM 0, BTS 0 and if it suffers one Wound it must be removed from the battlefield.  	 		Antipersonnel Mines	Combi Rifle	Light Shotgun	Knife	Pistol

The Hacking Device Plus has an additional advanced system of Localization-Identification-Liaison that works as a Forward Observer, but only within the Hacker's, or his Repeater's, Zone of Control (8 inches): LoF with the enemy is not required. In order to mark a target with the Hacker Device Plus Forward Observer function, it is necessary to spend an Order and pass a WIP Roll. The target can react by Dodging the marking of the Forward Observer Hacking Device Plus, provided he has LoF.	 AutoMediKit	This is a nano-medical device that some troops have integrated to their personal tactical equipment. It injects nanorepairers automatically in their systems allowing them to recover from the Unconscious state. It requires the spending of 1 Complete Order and the passing of a PH roll.

A Forward Observer in LoF with an enemy will be able to mark him after passing a WIP roll (Face to Face, or Normal, depending on the case), modified by Covers, Distance, Camouflage and Hiding Special Skill, or an Optical Disruptor Device. Distance Modifiers for marking with Forward Observer are applied as per the following table: There are two types of attacks that can be made as a result of the marking by a Forward Observer:   Speculative: When the Forward Observer passes his WIP Roll, the target remains marked for any other comrade that wants to shoot at that target, and the Speculative Fire Modifier is not applied.   Guided: When the Forward Observer passes his WIP Roll the target will remain marked for any other comrade possessing a weapon with Guided Ammunition. This figure will be able to use the Short Skill Ballistic Skills to hit the marked miniature without a roll required, as the WIP Roll of the Observer substitutes.   A miniature marked by a Forward Observer will be considered as marked until the end of the turn of the player possessing the Observer that marked it.

The area of explosion is that of a Circular Template, causing 13 Shock Damage to all in the area. The detonation caused by this Special Skill can be Dodged by passing a PH-6 Roll. Exploding is a Short Skill that allows the figure to explode at any moment he deems suitable, after passing a Normal WIP Roll. Activating this Special Skill will provoke a rapid death in its bearer. Exploding can be used in CC substituting the CC Attribute with WIP, the figure Exploding rather than causing a hit: this allows the figure to Explode without being Unconscious first. In the specific case of T.A.G.s with Combat Jump, such as the Caskuda, the explosion is only produced when hitting the ground: the figure will not suffer any damage and will not be able to explode again.  	 Poison	The miniature is able to secrete a neurotoxin which makes his blows highly lethal. Accordingly, the figure's CC weapon is counted as having Shock Special Ammunition. The effect of the Poison can be combined with any other Special Ammunition that his CC weapon possesses. In addition, each time a figure with the Poison Special Skill suffers a Wound in CC, his blood splatters automatically to cause a Damage 9 hit on his adversary. Blood splatters cause Normal (Never special) Damage, and as the direct result of a Short CC Skill, they cannot be dodged.  	 V: Dogged	This Special Skill is automatic and does not require the use of Orders to be activated. Dogged allows the miniature to ignore the state of Unconscious. If the miniature uses the Dogged Skill he will be able to act normally provided he keeps spending Orders in a consecutive way. The figure will die when the turn he would have fallen Unconscious finishes, if the player stops spending Orders on him in a consecutive way, or if he suffers another Wound. In addition, the Dogged Special Skill includes also the Courage Special Skill. Dogged cannot be used in ARO. Dogged allows Impetuous figures to spend Orders from the Orders Reserve in order to keep acting normally, even though the player hasn't finished spending Impetuous Orders.

Doctor is a Short Skill that allows the miniature, when in base contact, after passing a WIP Roll, to make his patient pass from the Unconscious state to Normal, with a single Wound. If he fails the WIP Roll, the figure is considered to be Dead and is removed from the game table. Miniatures can be healed as many times as necessary, provided that the WIP rolls are successful. A miniature that has been healed can also benefit later from a MediKit, AutoMediKit, or Regeneration, and vice versa. A figure must be in base to base contact with a patient to use the Doctor Special Skill. A Doctor with the Special Skill V: No Wound Incapacitation who has suffered one Wound can try to heal himself but if he fails the WIP roll he will die automatically.  	 Engineer	Any figure with this Special Skill has the means and technical knowledge required to carry out campaign repairs on faulty or damaged equipment. Engineer is a Short Skill that allows, with a successful Normal WIP Roll, the repair of Structure points (STR) of vehicles or figures (1 point per successful WIP Roll) which he is in base contact with. If the Engineer fails his WIP Roll, the target miniature or structure loses 1 point of STR instead of recovering it.  Engineers can reactivate all weapons, equipment and armour affected by E/M and Adhesive Special Ammunition if they they pass 1 single Normal WIP Roll when in contact with the affected figure. If the Engineer fails the WIP Roll when reactivating, it is considered that the weapon or equipment is permanently shut down with no possibility of recovery.  It is essential that a miniature be in base to base contact with the item he wants to repair.  Figures that posses this Short Skill can also open locks, applying the same Modifiers as Hacking Security and Information (See Advanced Rules: Hacking). In order to open/close a door, base to base contact is required.  Engineer also allows Mines to be deactivated (Antipersonnel and Monofilament), as well as E/Maulers and D-Charges. In order to deactivate a Mine in a same Order, the figure has to come into its action radius (Circular Template) and pass a WIP Roll. If successful, the Mine does not explode and is defused. If the WIP roll is failed, then it explodes, affecting the Engineer as normal.  	 								Combi Rifle	D-Charges	Knife	Pistol

A Forward Observer in LoF with an enemy will be able to mark him after passing a WIP roll (Face to Face, or Normal, depending on the case), modified by Covers, Distance, Camouflage and Hiding Special Skill, or an Optical Disruptor Device. Distance Modifiers for marking with Forward Observer are applied as per the following table: There are two types of attacks that can be made as a result of the marking by a Forward Observer:   Speculative: When the Forward Observer passes his WIP Roll, the target remains marked for any other comrade that wants to shoot at that target, and the Speculative Fire Modifier is not applied.   Guided: When the Forward Observer passes his WIP Roll the target will remain marked for any other comrade possessing a weapon with Guided Ammunition. This figure will be able to use the Short Skill Ballistic Skills to hit the marked miniature without a roll required, as the WIP Roll of the Observer substitutes.   A miniature marked by a Forward Observer will be considered as marked until the end of the turn of the player possessing the Observer that marked it. The special equipment of Forward Observers allows them to use the Flash Pulse.  	 G: Remote Presence	Remote Presence: This Special Skill is possessed by Remotes and unmanned T.A.G.s. Remotes have pseudo-AIs and expert programs that rule their behaviour in combat, operating in pure logic where fear has no place. In the case of Remote Presence T.A.G.s, the driver is not physically present on the battlefield and remotely controls it from a safe distance. Remote Presence is considered confers the Valor: Courage Special Skill. Figures with Remote Presence cannot have a Cube.  	 Multiterrain	Troops with Multiterrain Skill prepare themselves extensively for every mission, training with simulators or in zones that approximate the location where they will carry out their operations. Those troops stationed in adverse environments that include several types of Special Terrain (Aquatic and Jungle, for instance) will also possess Multiterrain. Before starting the battle, figures with Multiterrain will be able to choose in which type of terrain they will be specialized (See Terrain section). They will only be able to choose one type out of the five possible types (Aquatic, Desert, Mountain, Jungle, or Zero-G) and will reduce the MV difficulty of that Terrain by one level. This Special Skill is automatic and does not require any Order to be activated.  	 Repeater	Hacking range amplification system. This allows Hackers to use their skill in a radius of 8 inches around the Repeater. The Hacker can be at any distance from the Repeater, and he does not need to keep a LoF with it. This is a Special Skill that functions automatically and does not need the spending of any Orders to work. The Repeater can only be used by Hackers of the same army, or an allied one.  	 Sensor	The miniature possesses high sensitivity detection equipment, or a perfect sense of smell, that allows him to detect hidden figures nearby. The miniature that possess Sensor can make a Normal WIP Roll (Distance, Camouflage or TO Camouflage Modifiers are not applied) to Discover all models that are Camouflaged or in Hidden Deployment within a radius of 8 inches around him. Sensor is a Short Skill and does not need a LoF. A miniature possessing the Sensor and Forward Observer Special Skills can mark a target outside his LoF (using his pertinent Short Skill), if he is within the Sensor radius of effect and the target has been previously discovered. In such a case, a Distance, Cover, CH and ODD Modifiers will not be applied to the Forward Observer WIP roll. A miniature with Camouflage, TO Camouflage, or Impersonation cannot Camouflage again, or return to the Impersonation state, within the Sensor area.

A 360 Visor functions automatically and does not require the spending of an Order to be activated. It allows a LoF of 360, so the figure has no blind points and cannot be surprised from behind.  	 CH: Mimetism	The figure has the special ability to obscure his appearance to an enemy. Moreover, he has basic mimetic tools and clothes or camouflage gear made with a photosensitive material, a cheaper alternative to chameleonic tools, and knows how to use it with the maximum results in order to avoid discovery. In game terms, any miniature attacking a figure with Mimetism will have a -3 Modifier to his BS Attribute for ranged attacks.  	 G: Remote Presence	Remote Presence: This Special Skill is possessed by Remotes and unmanned T.A.G.s. Remotes have pseudo-AIs and expert programs that rule their behaviour in combat, operating in pure logic where fear has no place. In the case of Remote Presence T.A.G.s, the driver is not physically present on the battlefield and remotely controls it from a safe distance. Remote Presence is considered confers the Valor: Courage Special Skill. Figures with Remote Presence cannot have a Cube.  	 Repeater	Hacking range amplification system. This allows Hackers to use their skill in a radius of 8 inches around the Repeater. The Hacker can be at any distance from the Repeater, and he does not need to keep a LoF with it. This is a Special Skill that functions automatically and does not need the spending of any Orders to work. The Repeater can only be used by Hackers of the same army, or an allied one.  	 Total Reaction	Due to servos and a system of support and reinforcement of response speed and mobility, some miniatures are able to react with great celerity. To reflect this, Total Reaction allows the firing of the whole Burst (B) of a weapon in ARO. - If the BS roll is a Normal Roll, as many Rolls as the B value of the Weapon will be made. - If the BS roll is a Face to Face Roll, both players will have to make all their BS rolls.

Those troops stationed in adverse environments that include several types of Special Terrain (Aquatic and Jungle, for instance) will also possess Multiterrain. Before starting the battle, figures with Multiterrain will be able to choose in which type of terrain they will be specialized (See Terrain section). They will only be able to choose one type out of the five possible types (Aquatic, Desert, Mountain, Jungle, or Zero-G) and will reduce the MV difficulty of that Terrain by one level.

The active player can deploy a miniature with AD: Combat Jump at any point during the battle. The figure spends 1 Order (His own, not one from the Orders Reserve) and makes a PH Normal Roll. If successful he deploys to any point on the table nominated by his owner, facing in any direction desired. Dispersion: If he fails the PH roll, the miniature suffers a detour in his fall, deviating as many inches as the Failure Category multiplied by 2.5 (FC x 2.5). In order to determine in which direction the miniature deviates, a Circular Template is used. Place the Circular Template on the target point where the miniature was supposed to land, with the number 1 facing towards the centre of the table. The second digit of the dice Roll is used indicate the direction in which the miniature deviate. If deviation prompts the figure to fall outside the battlefield, he will have to spend an extra Order from the Order Reserve to appear on the border of the game table at the point where he would have left. A figure cannot nominate as jump target the interior of a Smoke zone, or in Impassable Terrain or Zones of Low or Zero Visibility. The landing zone is of the same size as a Circular Template and must be free of scenery elements. The figure with Combat Jump can land on any point in the landing zone but the whole of its base must be in the interior of the Circular Template. A figure cannot land in base to base contact with another miniature. If a Coordinated Order is used to perform a Combat Jump, all the miniatures participating must choose the same template as their landing point. Those failing their PH Roll will be dispersed individually. Figures possessing Combat Jump can also deploy themselves, if they wish to, as if they possessed the preceding levels in AD.  Remotes with Combat Jump will have to perform a PH Roll in order to jump. PH determines the automation and programming level of their jumps.  Impetuous Figures with Combat Jump will have to use their Impetuous Order to perform their jump. If they do not want to jump immediately, at the beginning of the turn they must spend an Order from their army's Orders Reserve in order to stop each impetuous figure from deploying with their Impetuous Order.	 AI Beacon	AI Beacon: Data net signal emitter which allow Artificial Intelligences to enhance the range and effectiveness of their particular data sphere. In game terms, the function of an AI Beacon is to provide 1 Order to the Order Reserve of its army. An AI Beacon must always be deployed with AD: Combat Jump, but its deployment is performed during the Deployment Phase. If its Dispersion means it falls off the game table, it must be considered lost and cannot be recovered during the battle. An AI Beacon must be assigned to a Combat Group, which cannot surpass the maximum of ten Orders. This piece of Equipment is vulnerable to E/M Special Ammunition and cannot be picked up with the Booty Special Skill.	 								Electric Pulse

Engineers can reactivate all weapons, equipment and armour affected by E/M and Adhesive Special Ammunition if they they pass 1 single Normal WIP Roll when in contact with the affected figure.

AD: Combat Jump	Figures with this special jump equipment are trained to descend at full speed over the battlefield surprising enemies with devastating sudden attacks. The active player can deploy a miniature with AD: Combat Jump at any point during the battle. The figure spends 1 Order (His own, not one from the Orders Reserve) and makes a PH Normal Roll. If successful he deploys to any point on the table nominated by his owner, facing in any direction desired. Dispersion: If he fails the PH roll, the miniature suffers a detour in his fall, deviating as many inches as the Failure Category multiplied by 2.5 (FC x 2.5). In order to determine in which direction the miniature deviates, a Circular Template is used. Place the Circular Template on the target point where the miniature was supposed to land, with the number 1 facing towards the centre of the table. The second digit of the dice Roll is used indicate the direction in which the miniature deviate. If deviation prompts the figure to fall outside the battlefield, he will have to spend an extra Order from the Order Reserve to appear on the border of the game table at the point where he would have left. A figure cannot nominate as jump target the interior of a Smoke zone, or in Impassable Terrain or Zones of Low or Zero Visibility. The landing zone is of the same size as a Circular Template and must be free of scenery elements. The figure with Combat Jump can land on any point in the landing zone but the whole of its base must be in the interior of the Circular Template. A figure cannot land in base to base contact with another miniature. If a Coordinated Order is used to perform a Combat Jump, all the miniatures participating must choose the same template as their landing point. Those failing their PH Roll will be dispersed individually. Figures possessing Combat Jump can also deploy themselves, if they wish to, as if they possessed the preceding levels in AD.  Remotes with Combat Jump will have to perform a PH Roll in order to jump. PH determines the automation and programming level of their jumps.  Impetuous Figures with Combat Jump will have to use their Impetuous Order to perform their jump. If they do not want to jump immediately, at the beginning of the turn they must spend an Order from their army's Orders Reserve in order to stop each impetuous figure from deploying with their Impetuous Order.	 Morat	The Morat are the militarist race par excellence. Morat troops possess an ingrained feeling of belonging to their combat units. Their instruction and training have produced an attack force where an individual sense of duty and personal honour is sublimated to those of the group. The Morat are very strict, follow rules to the letter and will fight until no soldier is on his feet: for this reason they will not disperse until they accomplish their mission. All the Morat have a racial ability equivalent to the Religious Troop Special Skill. In addition, the presence of Morat troops in an army increases the Retreat! threshold from 60% to 75%.

He will also have chameleonic tools available: photoreactive cells and variable/ combinable environment patterns. These clothing-incorporated systems will merge the miniature with his surroundings. The Special Skill of Camouflage allows its owner to perform:   Camouflaged Deployment: This use is exclusive to the deployment phase and does not require the spending of any Orders or making of rolls. The miniature is not deployed in the usual way: a Camouflage Marker is placed instead. This type of Deployment also allows 3 miniatures (All with the Special Skill of Camouflage) to be deployed under the same Marker. One or more miniatures can be separated from the group at any point in the game, moving as a separate Camouflage Marker. All the figures placed under the Camouflage Marker are revealed if the adversary makes a successful Discover Roll, or if some of the figures perform an Order that uncovers them. When revealed, figures must appear no more than inch of distance from each other, although the player can place them facing however he likes. In game terms, a Camouflage Marker is always the same height as a base troop figure from its own army (Unless it has a Prone Marker beside it).   Camouflage in Movement: This allows the player to move the miniature without placing him on the battlefield. Only his Camouflage Marker will move. When several miniatures are moved under the same Camouflage Marker, they behave as if they were only one miniature. If they have different MOV values, the lowest is always used. The only Skills whose execution does not automatically rreveal the camouflaged figures are Cautious Movement and all Short Skills of Movement that do not require any roll (except Alert). The camouflaged figure reveals automatically when it is in base contact with another figure. If the figure is Discovered or is automatically revealed, the Camouflage Marker is replaced by its miniature (or miniatures), facing how the player prefers. If a Camouflage Marker does not perform anything but MOV in his turn, even if it crosses a Suppression Fire zone or a figure's ZC, the only ARO that can be executed against it is Discover or Change Facing.   Defensive Camouflage: To act against a Camouflage Marker, enemies must succeed in a Discover roll with a -3 Modifier. If the roll is failed, the camouflaged figure is not perceived and may not be a target of BS, CC, or any other Skill (Hacking, Sepsitor, etc.). If the Camouflaged miniature (Or miniatures, if they are clustered) is discovered, it will have to be placed on the battlefield, substituting the Camouflage Maker and losing all the advantages of Camouflage in Movement and Combat, but still complicating any BS Roll against him with a Modifier of -3. When placing the figure over terrain, he can face any direction his owner chooses.   Combat Camouflage: This allows a miniature in a camouflaged state to make a BS, Forward Observer, Sepsitor or Hacking attack before his opponent does. This attack is made with a Normal Roll. If the adversary survives the attack, he may then make any attacks he may have declared in ARO which are also made as Normal Rolls, with -3 to BS if shooting at the revealed figure. After this, the player will have to replace the Camouflage Marker with the correct figure. Combat Camouflage is only available for use with Ballistic Skills. In ARO, the reactions of Camouflaged soldiers are simultaneous to the Order they react to, so Face to Face Rolls will be made. If the Camouflaged figure receives an Intuitive Attack without having been Discovered first, he will have to reveal himself even if he passes the ARM Roll, removing the Camouflage Marker and placing the real figure. In the same way, if he is affected by a Template but the target was another figure, he will have to make an ARM Roll, revealing himself whether he passes the roll or not.   Camouflaging Again: When a figure has lost the Camouflaged status (It is represented by its figure and not a Camouflage Marker), he can recover his former status by spending 1 Order, provided that he is not in the LoF of any enemy miniatures. A figure in TO Camouflage in LoF of a miniature that intends to Camouflage itself again will have to reveal himself if he desires to prevent his enemy from re-entering Camouflaged status.	 S: Protheion	This Special Skill is a biogenetic enhancement which allows the user to extract nutrients and organic matter from other living beings to boost his own health. Protheion is a CC Attack. It requires spending of a Short Skill or an ARO, without any roll necessary, and also requires the user be in base contact with another biological creature in an Unconscious state. Each Wound added to the user will remove a Wound from the miniature the user is absorbing nutrients from. A figure with Protheion may absorb wounds until they have a maximum of 3 in total at any given time. This means a figure beginning the game with a Wound value of 1 may absorb up to 2 bonus Wounds, while a figure starting with a Wound value of 2 may absorb 1. If any Wounds are lost, they may be re-absorbed up to the maximum of 3 Wounds in total. This Special Skill can be used in an aggressive way, absorbing Wounds even if the user is yet to be damaged.  Against foes in a normal state (Not Unconscious), Protheion is used in CC Combat. The figure with Protheion makes a CC Face to Face Roll against the opponent's defending Attribute, with success forcing victims to make a BTS roll against the PH of the user or transfer one of their Wounds. A victim of Protheion can lose all his Wounds, and his Unconscious level too, which counts as a Wound. Criticals with Protheion absorb a Wound directly from the target, avoiding the BTS Roll.  The Protheion Special Skill cannot be used against figures with the STR Attribute.  Moreover, Protheion includes the V: Dogged Special Skill. However if it is used by a figure with the Shasvastii Special Skill, the Spawn-Embryo rule cannot be used later, because the miniature will consume it to activate the V: Dogged Special Skill. If, when using the Dogged Special Skill, the figure with Protheion regenerates one or more Wounds, the Dogged state is cancelled. The use of Protheion is always considered a CC Attack, this means this Special Skill cannot be used against allied troops.  	 Shasvastii	The Shavastii are an alien race with a completely different biology to humans. Endowed with a strong survival instinct, all the Shasvastii are partially hermaphroditic, allowing them to bear a fast growth Spawn-Embryo inside them that they will later implant in enemy territory. After some time, a Shasvastii will sprout from the Spawn-Embryo, which will follow genetically codified information to continue the mission of the Shasvastii Continuum. Spawn-Embryos can feed from the corpse of the fallen Shasvastii, so it is considered that no Shasvastii troop yields Victory Points to his enemy until his Spawn-Embryo has been wiped out. It is therefore considered that, to count VP for victory as for Retreat! Shasvastii have three levels: Unconscious, Dead, and Spawn. When the Shasvastii is Dead, replace it with a Spawn-Embryo Marker (SPAWNEMBRYO). The Spawn-Embryo cannot move from its location, attack, or defend itself. It has ARM 0, BTS 0 and if it suffers one Wound it must be removed from the battlefield.  	 						Combi Rifle	Adhesive Launcher	Knife	Pistol

The Protheion Special Skill cannot be used against figures with the STR Attribute.  Moreover, Protheion includes the V: Dogged Special Skill. However if it is used by a figure with the Shasvastii Special Skill, the Spawn-Embryo rule cannot be used later, because the miniature will consume it to activate the V: Dogged Special Skill. If, when using the Dogged Special Skill, the figure with Protheion regenerates one or more Wounds, the Dogged state is cancelled. The use of Protheion is always considered a CC Attack, this means this Special Skill cannot be used against allied troops.  	 Shasvastii	The Shavastii are an alien race with a completely different biology to humans. Endowed with a strong survival instinct, all the Shasvastii are partially hermaphroditic, allowing them to bear a fast growth Spawn-Embryo inside them that they will later implant in enemy territory. After some time, a Shasvastii will sprout from the Spawn-Embryo, which will follow genetically codified information to continue the mission of the Shasvastii Continuum. Spawn-Embryos can feed from the corpse of the fallen Shasvastii, so it is considered that no Shasvastii troop yields Victory Points to his enemy until his Spawn-Embryo has been wiped out. It is therefore considered that, to count VP for victory as for Retreat! Shasvastii have three levels: Unconscious, Dead, and Spawn. When the Shasvastii is Dead, replace it with a Spawn-Embryo Marker (SPAWNEMBRYO). The Spawn-Embryo cannot move from its location, attack, or defend itself.

Camouflaging again: Functions exactly as CH: L-2 Camouflage	 Climbing Plus	A miniature with Climbing Plus is specially equipped or gifted at climbing. This Special Skill functions automatically and allows the miniature to climb as many inches as his MOV Attribute, with no need to make a PH Roll. The Climbing Plus Special Skill allows the figure to perform other skills while climbing or hanging from a great height (Climbing+BS per example).  	 ECM	Electronic Countermeasures. This term encompasses all devices that vehicles and T.A.G.s use to avoid and neutralize incoming enemy guided projectiles. Standard ECM includes a system of fire detection, localization and proximity radars as well as small battery of micromissiles loaded with nanotechnological chaff. This equipment tampers with the systems of enemy guided projectiles, forcing them to deviate from their target and to explode out of range. ECM from Ariadna are similar to modern ones, although comparatively bigger. Instead of nanotech micromissiles, their ECM systems are equipped with a battery of rockets that create a wall of explosions that detonate enemy guided projectiles. ECM has a standard level of 5, requiring a Normal Roll of 5 or less for each incoming guided projectiles to deflect and detonate the projectile without causing any damage. ECM functions automatically and does not require spending of any Orders or having LoF and can be used in ARO. ECM allows reacting in ARO against enemy guided projectiles.  	 G: Remote Presence	Remote Presence: This Special Skill is possessed by Remotes and unmanned T.A.G.s. Remotes have pseudo-AIs and expert programs that rule their behaviour in combat, operating in pure logic where fear has no place. In the case of Remote Presence T.A.G.s, the driver is not physically present on the battlefield and remotely controls it from a safe distance. Remote Presence is considered confers the Valor: Courage Special Skill. Figures with Remote Presence cannot have a Cube.  	 Multiterrain	Troops with Multiterrain Skill prepare themselves extensively for every mission, training with simulators or in zones that approximate the location where they will carry out their operations. Those troops stationed in adverse environments that include several types of Special Terrain (Aquatic and Jungle, for instance) will also possess Multiterrain. Before starting the battle, figures with Multiterrain will be able to choose in which type of terrain they will be specialized (See Terrain section). They will only be able to choose one type out of the five possible types (Aquatic, Desert, Mountain, Jungle, or Zero-G) and will reduce the MV difficulty of that Terrain by one level.

When its body is finished growing and the information, plans and aptitudes necessary to accomplish its mission are implanted, the miniature will emerge from the capsule, ready for combat. Troops with this Special Skill are deployed on the battlefield in the shape of a Seed-Embryo. This capsule, which is heavily armoured, cannot do anything and only has ARM, BTS and W Attributes. It is vulnerable to E/M (being Immobilized) but it cannot be hacked. The Seed-Embryo stands still, without moving, giving one Order to the Order Reserve of its army until its player's second turn, or until the next player's turn following its deployment. At the beginning of its second turn, before the Impetuous Orders sequence and without spending any Order, the Seed-Embryo is replaced by the miniature, fully equipped, facing wherever its player wishes and able to act immediately. In an emergency situation, the player can, if he wishes, spend 1 Short Skill or an ARO to hatch the Seed-Embryo prematurely. The SeedEmbryo only can hatch reactively to any actions made by the enemy inside its Zone of Control or its 360 LoF. In addition, it is equipped with a stealth device which provides it with CH: Limited Camouflage until it hatches. If the Seed-Embryo is discovered, replace the Camouflage Marker with a SeedEmbryo (SEED-EMBRYO) Marker. Those Seed-Embryos which have the AD: Combat Jump Special Skill cannot be deployed using any other level abilities of Airborne Deployment. A landed capsule will hatch automatically in the player's next turn following its landing; immediately by spending 1 Short Skill; or by spending one ARO during another player's turn. As they are used to being deployed in dangerous areas, and lack the stealth device which is disabled after a landing, the capsules of Seed-Embryos with AD: Combat Jump have an Electric Pulse and a single use defensive device, which works like an Antipersonnel Mine if enemy models approach within range of an unhatched capsule. A Seed-Embryo that scatters off the battlefield will need to spend 2 Orders to appear on the border of the table, at the same point where it left. It is hatched when placed on the table.	 Shasvastii	The Shavastii are an alien race with a completely different biology to humans. Endowed with a strong survival instinct, all the Shasvastii are partially hermaphroditic, allowing them to bear a fast growth Spawn-Embryo inside them that they will later implant in enemy territory. After some time, a Shasvastii will sprout from the Spawn-Embryo, which will follow genetically codified information to continue the mission of the Shasvastii Continuum. Spawn-Embryos can feed from the corpse of the fallen Shasvastii, so it is considered that no Shasvastii troop yields Victory Points to his enemy until his Spawn-Embryo has been wiped out. It is therefore considered that, to count VP for victory as for Retreat! Shasvastii have three levels: Unconscious, Dead, and Spawn. When the Shasvastii is Dead, replace it with a Spawn-Embryo Marker (SPAWNEMBRYO). The Spawn-Embryo cannot move from its location, attack, or defend itself.

A Forward Observer in LoF with an enemy will be able to mark him after passing a WIP roll (Face to Face, or Normal, depending on the case), modified by Covers, Distance, Camouflage and Hiding Special Skill, or an Optical Disruptor Device. Distance Modifiers for marking with Forward Observer are applied as per the following table: There are two types of attacks that can be made as a result of the marking by a Forward Observer:   Speculative: When the Forward Observer passes his WIP Roll, the target remains marked for any other comrade that wants to shoot at that target, and the Speculative Fire Modifier is not applied.   Guided: When the Forward Observer passes his WIP Roll the target will remain marked for any other comrade possessing a weapon with Guided Ammunition. This figure will be able to use the Short Skill Ballistic Skills to hit the marked miniature without a roll required, as the WIP Roll of the Observer substitutes.   A miniature marked by a Forward Observer will be considered as marked until the end of the turn of the player possessing the Observer that marked it. The special equipment of Forward Observers allows them to use the Flash Pulse.  	 Seed-Embryo	The miniature is deployed inside a life maintenance and body-developing capsule. When its body is finished growing and the information, plans and aptitudes necessary to accomplish its mission are implanted, the miniature will emerge from the capsule, ready for combat. Troops with this Special Skill are deployed on the battlefield in the shape of a Seed-Embryo. This capsule, which is heavily armoured, cannot do anything and only has ARM, BTS and W Attributes. It is vulnerable to E/M (being Immobilized) but it cannot be hacked. The Seed-Embryo stands still, without moving, giving one Order to the Order Reserve of its army until its player's second turn, or until the next player's turn following its deployment. At the beginning of its second turn, before the Impetuous Orders sequence and without spending any Order, the Seed-Embryo is replaced by the miniature, fully equipped, facing wherever its player wishes and able to act immediately. In an emergency situation, the player can, if he wishes, spend 1 Short Skill or an ARO to hatch the Seed-Embryo prematurely. The SeedEmbryo only can hatch reactively to any actions made by the enemy inside its Zone of Control or its 360 LoF. In addition, it is equipped with a stealth device which provides it with CH: Limited Camouflage until it hatches. If the Seed-Embryo is discovered, replace the Camouflage Marker with a SeedEmbryo (SEED-EMBRYO) Marker. Those Seed-Embryos which have the AD: Combat Jump Special Skill cannot be deployed using any other level abilities of Airborne Deployment.

It is used to heal Unconscious miniatures. Using the MediKit is a Short Skill that requires a PH Roll with a -3 Modifier by the patient. If he fails his roll, he will immediately pass to the Dead state and will be removed from the game table. If he passes the roll, the patient recovers 1 Wound, automatically leaving the Unconscious state and contributing his Order again to the Orders Reserve of his army in the next active turn. With a MediKit, miniatures can be healed from the Unconscious state as many times as necessary, provided they pass their PH-3 Rolls. Human MediKits do not work on Aliens (Assault Packs, Dog-Warriors, etc.) and vice versa. The MediKit is the most frequent medical system of nano-injection on battlefields. There are several syringe models; the most modern being a device with the form of a gun, using a chamber with a magnetic coil. After introducing the nanotreatment cartridge and pulling the electric trigger, the magnetic field accelerator injects at high speed the medical nanobots suspended in the cartridge serum. Other versions of the MediKit are the hypo-spray, with a lower speed performance, or the archaic pneumatic pistols.

Moreover, he has basic mimetic tools and clothes or camouflage gear made with a photosensitive material, a cheaper alternative to chameleonic tools, and knows how to use it with the maximum results in order to avoid discovery. In game terms, any miniature attacking a figure with Mimetism will have a -3 Modifier to his BS Attribute for ranged attacks.  	 G: Servant	With Ghost: Servant, the figure and the Remote are activated at the same time with only 1 Order. It works similarly to Ghost: Synchronized, as both must declare the same Order. If one of the two figures cannot perform the complete Order (the Long Skill or both Short Skills of the Order), he will be inactive and he will not perform the Order. However, if he can only perform one of the two Short Skills of the Order, then he will perform that single Skill, while the other figure will perform the complete Order. The difference from Ghost: Synchronized is that the Doctor/ Engineer makes the WIP roll, and it is the Remote who performs it. The Doctor/ Engineer can heal, repair or act through the Ghost: Servant, but it is necessary that the Remote be in base contact with the target. The Remote has not the Doctor neither the Engineer Special Skills: it cannot heal or repair by itself as it need to be controlled by the Doctor/ Engineer. Usually, to allow the Servant Remote moves until reach its target, the Doctor/ Engineer declares the Order but doesn't perform it, being in a safe place on the battlefield. Meanwhile, it is the Servant Remote who performs the Order, moving until in base contact with the target. The Doctor/ Engineer and the Remote only provide a single Order to the Orders Reserve and both are activated with only one Order. It is mandatory both figures belong to the same Combat Group where they count as a single figure. A Doctor/ Engineer can have more than 1 Servant Remote, but he can only activate them one by one, applying the other rules considerations. Meanwhile, the other Remotes will be inactive. As they are activated by one single Order, the Doctor/ Engineer and the Remote will provide a single ARO to each figure with LoF to either or both of them. If they cross a Suppression Fire (SF) zone, both can receive shots from the shooter maintaining the SF. The Doctor/ Engineer and the Remote each get their own ARO in reaction to every Order declared in their LoF or inside their Zone of Control. These AROs must be the same for both figures, applying the Ghost: Synchronized rule.  The Doctor/ Engineer can see through the sensors and optical devices of his Remote, so he can react to any Order declared in LoF or ZC of his Remote with Alert, Change Facing, Dodging or with any Skill which does not require LoF to perform. The Servant Remote always disconnects automatically if the Doctor/ Engineer is out of the game table (Due to Airborne Deployment, Hidden Deployment, ...) or if he falls Unconscious or Dead. A disconnected Remote stands still and cannot receive Orders or perform AROs. An Immobilized (IMM) Marker must be placed beside the base of a disconnected Remote. The Remote connects automatically, without spending any Order or Short Skill, at the end of an Order in which the Doctor/ Engineer comes back from Unconscious state or enters the game table. Contrary to Ghost: Synchronized, there is no limit in the operating distance between the Servant Remote and its Doctor/ Engineer. Servant Remotes are Not Impetuous figures, so they cannot be activated with Impetuous Orders.  Remotes with Ghost: Servant which possess the Airborne Deployment (AD) Special Skill can be deployed by spending 1 Order from the Order Reserve or, if the player prefers, by using the same Order through which its Doctor/ Engineer is deployed, without requiring the spending of an additional Order. In such a situation, they must be deployed at the same time and from the same side of the game table, or using the same Circular Template, as their Doctor/ Engineer. Remotes with Ghost: Servant also have the G: Remote Presence Special Skill. Remotes with Ghost: Servant don't provide Victory Points to the enemy and are not counted as casualties for the Retreat! rule. If the Doctor/ Engineer is hacked (If he is liable to be hacked) or if he receives a hit from E/M Special Ammunition and fails his BTS roll, his Remote will disconnect automatically because its link is interrupted. The Remote will connect again at the end of the Order in which the Doctor/ Engineer is freed from the hacking or his equipment is repaired. A sepsitorized Doctor/ Engineer can use his Ghost: Servant in the normal way.	 								Electric Pulse

This is a system that curves the light around its bearer, rendering him almost invisible and erasing his thermal signature. This sophisticated device also diffuses any possible atmospheric turbulence that its bearer may provoke and prevents his detection by radar or sonar. In game terms, TO Camouflage allows its possessor to perform the following:   Hidden Deployment: It allows the same type of deployment as CH: L-2 Camouflage, but there is no need to make use of a Marker. Provided that he does not move, the figure with CH: TO Camouflage will remain completely invisible. The player must take note of his figure's position in the most detailed possible way (Cover, Prone, etc.) so that the adversary will be able to verify the data in the moment in which he reveals his position. If the miniature moves, the player must place a TO Camouflage Marker, and show his adversary that he really was in that position from the beginning of the battle. If the figure performs any other action, he will have to be replaced by the miniature instead of the Marker. A miniature in Hidden Deployment does not add his Order to the Orders Reserve, as he is not on the game table. However, to carry out his first Order, which reveals his presence on the battlefield, he will not receive the Order from the Orders Reserve but will have to spend his own.   Camouflage in Movement: Allows the miniature to carry out the same Camouflaged Movement allowed by CH: Camouflage.   TO Defensive Camouflage: Allows the miniature the same Defensive Camouflage that CH: Camouflage provides, but a negative Modifier of -6 is applied if someone intends to attack him.   TO Combat Camouflage: Allows the same Combat Camouflage as CH: L-2 Camouflage, with no orders needing to be spent.   Camouflaging again: Functions exactly as CH: L-2 Camouflage	 G: Mnemonica	The Mnemonica Special Skill is a typical troop feature of the EI. If the original body chosen to host the Aspect of the EI that controls the army (Charontid, Anathematic or Avatar) is destroyed in combat, the Aspect will automatically jump to another figure's Cube in his army. The Aspect can also jump when his body is in an Unconscious state, but this will cause the body to automatically autodestruct and it must be removed from the game table. The Mnemonica Special Skill does not require the spending of an Order and functions automatically. Mnemonica allows the EI to continue acting as Lieutenant in his army with no Loss of Lieutenant situation incurred whilst there are figures where it can discharge itself. When activating Mnemonica in another figure of the Combined Army, he will acquire the original WIP of the EI's Aspect (16 or 17), and the Ghost: Mnemonica Special Skill, but he will not be able to make use of any other Special Skill owned by the original body of the Aspect, or his equipment such as Sepsitor, Multispectral Visor, TO Camouflage, etc. Ghost: Mnemonica includes too the Ghost: Remote Presence Special Skill.  	 V: No Wound Incapacitation	This Special Skill functions automatically, allowing the miniature, after receiving a Wound, to avoid passing to the Unconscious state. Another Wound will be needed to destroy him. The miniature can be cured by a Doctor, AutoMediKit, MediKit, and Regeneration, although if he fails this roll he will automatically die.

Another Wound will be needed to destroy him. The miniature can be cured by a Doctor, AutoMediKit, MediKit, and Regeneration, although if he fails this roll he will automatically die.	 Shasvastii	The Shavastii are an alien race with a completely different biology to humans. Endowed with a strong survival instinct, all the Shasvastii are partially hermaphroditic, allowing them to bear a fast growth Spawn-Embryo inside them that they will later implant in enemy territory. After some time, a Shasvastii will sprout from the Spawn-Embryo, which will follow genetically codified information to continue the mission of the Shasvastii Continuum. Spawn-Embryos can feed from the corpse of the fallen Shasvastii, so it is considered that no Shasvastii troop yields Victory Points to his enemy until his Spawn-Embryo has been wiped out. It is therefore considered that, to count VP for victory as for Retreat! Shasvastii have three levels: Unconscious, Dead, and Spawn. When the Shasvastii is Dead, replace it with a Spawn-Embryo Marker (SPAWNEMBRYO). The Spawn-Embryo cannot move from its location, attack, or defend itself. It has ARM 0, BTS 0 and if it suffers one Wound it must be removed from the battlefield.  	 S: Protheion	This Special Skill is a biogenetic enhancement which allows the user to extract nutrients and organic matter from other living beings to boost his own health. Protheion is a CC Attack. It requires spending of a Short Skill or an ARO, without any roll necessary, and also requires the user be in base contact with another biological creature in an Unconscious state. Each Wound added to the user will remove a Wound from the miniature the user is absorbing nutrients from. A figure with Protheion may absorb wounds until they have a maximum of 3 in total at any given time. This means a figure beginning the game with a Wound value of 1 may absorb up to 2 bonus Wounds, while a figure starting with a Wound value of 2 may absorb 1. If any Wounds are lost, they may be re-absorbed up to the maximum of 3 Wounds in total. This Special Skill can be used in an aggressive way, absorbing Wounds even if the user is yet to be damaged.  Against foes in a normal state (Not Unconscious), Protheion is used in CC Combat. The figure with Protheion makes a CC Face to Face Roll against the opponent's defending Attribute, with success forcing victims to make a BTS roll against the PH of the user or transfer one of their Wounds. A victim of Protheion can lose all his Wounds, and his Unconscious level too, which counts as a Wound. Criticals with Protheion absorb a Wound directly from the target, avoiding the BTS Roll.  The Protheion Special Skill cannot be used against figures with the STR Attribute.  Moreover, Protheion includes the V: Dogged Special Skill. However if it is used by a figure with the Shasvastii Special Skill, the Spawn-Embryo rule cannot be used later, because the miniature will consume it to activate the V: Dogged Special Skill. If, when using the Dogged Special Skill, the figure with Protheion regenerates one or more Wounds, the Dogged state is cancelled. The use of Protheion is always considered a CC Attack, this means this Special Skill cannot be used against allied troops.  	 Personality		MULTI Rifle	Nanopulser	D-Charges	Pistol	DA CCW

Another Wound will be needed to destroy him. The miniature can be cured by a Doctor, AutoMediKit, MediKit, and Regeneration, although if he fails this roll he will automatically die.	 Shasvastii	The Shavastii are an alien race with a completely different biology to humans.

Each Wound added to the user will remove a Wound from the miniature the user is absorbing nutrients from. A figure with Protheion may absorb wounds until they have a maximum of 3 in total at any given time. This means a figure beginning the game with a Wound value of 1 may absorb up to 2 bonus Wounds, while a figure starting with a Wound value of 2 may absorb 1.

Engineer is a Short Skill that allows, with a successful Normal WIP Roll, the repair of Structure points (STR) of vehicles or figures (1 point per successful WIP Roll) which he is in base contact with. If the Engineer fails his WIP Roll, the target miniature or structure loses 1 point of STR instead of recovering it.  Engineers can reactivate all weapons, equipment and armour affected by E/M and Adhesive Special Ammunition if they they pass 1 single Normal WIP Roll when in contact with the affected figure. If the Engineer fails the WIP Roll when reactivating, it is considered that the weapon or equipment is permanently shut down with no possibility of recovery.  It is essential that a miniature be in base to base contact with the item he wants to repair.  Figures that posses this Short Skill can also open locks, applying the same Modifiers as Hacking Security and Information (See Advanced Rules: Hacking). In order to open/close a door, base to base contact is required.  Engineer also allows Mines to be deactivated (Antipersonnel and Monofilament), as well as E/Maulers and D-Charges. In order to deactivate a Mine in a same Order, the figure has to come into its action radius (Circular Template) and pass a WIP Roll. If successful, the Mine does not explode and is defused. If the WIP roll is failed, then it explodes, affecting the Engineer as normal.  	 Seed-Embryo	The miniature is deployed inside a life maintenance and body-developing capsule.

Engineer is a Short Skill that allows, with a successful Normal WIP Roll, the repair of Structure points (STR) of vehicles or figures (1 point per successful WIP Roll) which he is in base contact with. If the Engineer fails his WIP Roll, the target miniature or structure loses 1 point of STR instead of recovering it.  Engineers can reactivate all weapons, equipment and armour affected by E/M and Adhesive Special Ammunition if they they pass 1 single Normal WIP Roll when in contact with the affected figure. If the Engineer fails the WIP Roll when reactivating, it is considered that the weapon or equipment is permanently shut down with no possibility of recovery.  It is essential that a miniature be in base to base contact with the item he wants to repair.  Figures that posses this Short Skill can also open locks, applying the same Modifiers as Hacking Security and Information (See Advanced Rules: Hacking). In order to open/close a door, base to base contact is required.  Engineer also allows Mines to be deactivated (Antipersonnel and Monofilament), as well as E/Maulers and D-Charges. In order to deactivate a Mine in a same Order, the figure has to come into its action radius (Circular Template) and pass a WIP Roll. If successful, the Mine does not explode and is defused. If the WIP roll is failed, then it explodes, affecting the Engineer as normal.  	 Seed-Embryo	The miniature is deployed inside a life maintenance and body-developing capsule. When its body is finished growing and the information, plans and aptitudes necessary to accomplish its mission are implanted, the miniature will emerge from the capsule, ready for combat. Troops with this Special Skill are deployed on the battlefield in the shape of a Seed-Embryo. This capsule, which is heavily armoured, cannot do anything and only has ARM, BTS and W Attributes. It is vulnerable to E/M (being Immobilized) but it cannot be hacked. The Seed-Embryo stands still, without moving, giving one Order to the Order Reserve of its army until its player's second turn, or until the next player's turn following its deployment. At the beginning of its second turn, before the Impetuous Orders sequence and without spending any Order, the Seed-Embryo is replaced by the miniature, fully equipped, facing wherever its player wishes and able to act immediately. In an emergency situation, the player can, if he wishes, spend 1 Short Skill or an ARO to hatch the Seed-Embryo prematurely. The SeedEmbryo only can hatch reactively to any actions made by the enemy inside its Zone of Control or its 360 LoF. In addition, it is equipped with a stealth device which provides it with CH: Limited Camouflage until it hatches. If the Seed-Embryo is discovered, replace the Camouflage Marker with a SeedEmbryo (SEED-EMBRYO) Marker. Those Seed-Embryos which have the AD: Combat Jump Special Skill cannot be deployed using any other level abilities of Airborne Deployment. A landed capsule will hatch automatically in the player's next turn following its landing; immediately by spending 1 Short Skill; or by spending one ARO during another player's turn.

Engineer is a Short Skill that allows, with a successful Normal WIP Roll, the repair of Structure points (STR) of vehicles or figures (1 point per successful WIP Roll) which he is in base contact with. If the Engineer fails his WIP Roll, the target miniature or structure loses 1 point of STR instead of recovering it.  Engineers can reactivate all weapons, equipment and armour affected by E/M and Adhesive Special Ammunition if they they pass 1 single Normal WIP Roll when in contact with the affected figure. If the Engineer fails the WIP Roll when reactivating, it is considered that the weapon or equipment is permanently shut down with no possibility of recovery.  It is essential that a miniature be in base to base contact with the item he wants to repair.  Figures that posses this Short Skill can also open locks, applying the same Modifiers as Hacking Security and Information (See Advanced Rules: Hacking). In order to open/close a door, base to base contact is required.  Engineer also allows Mines to be deactivated (Antipersonnel and Monofilament), as well as E/Maulers and D-Charges.
