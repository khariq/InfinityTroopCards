This element does not count as a Support Weapon when performing the Support Weapons calculation in army construction. The Booty does not substitute for the figure's basic equipment: it is instead a complement. Before starting the battle a roll is made on the table to ascertain which extra element of equipment the figure has. If, in the course of a battle, a unit with the Special Skill Booty finds the dying body of another figure (in Unconscious state), he can spend 1 Order to scavenge. He may gain the figure's ARM value instead of his own, or take one of its weapons or pieces of equipment. He will be able to pick only one object and in return must throw away any piece of Booty he is currently carrying.  	 AD: Combat Jump	Figures with this special jump equipment are trained to descend at full speed over the battlefield surprising enemies with devastating sudden attacks. The active player can deploy a miniature with AD: Combat Jump at any point during the battle. The figure spends 1 Order (His own, not one from the Orders Reserve) and makes a PH Normal Roll. If successful he deploys to any point on the table nominated by his owner, facing in any direction desired. Dispersion: If he fails the PH roll, the miniature suffers a detour in his fall, deviating as many inches as the Failure Category multiplied by 2.5 (FC x 2.5). In order to determine in which direction the miniature deviates, a Circular Template is used. Place the Circular Template on the target point where the miniature was supposed to land, with the number 1 facing towards the centre of the table. The second digit of the dice Roll is used indicate the direction in which the miniature deviate. If deviation prompts the figure to fall outside the battlefield, he will have to spend an extra Order from the Order Reserve to appear on the border of the game table at the point where he would have left. A figure cannot nominate as jump target the interior of a Smoke zone, or in Impassable Terrain or Zones of Low or Zero Visibility. The landing zone is of the same size as a Circular Template and must be free of scenery elements. The figure with Combat Jump can land on any point in the landing zone but the whole of its base must be in the interior of the Circular Template. A figure cannot land in base to base contact with another miniature. If a Coordinated Order is used to perform a Combat Jump, all the miniatures participating must choose the same template as their landing point. Those failing their PH Roll will be dispersed individually. Figures possessing Combat Jump can also deploy themselves, if they wish to, as if they possessed the preceding levels in AD.  Remotes with Combat Jump will have to perform a PH Roll in order to jump. PH determines the automation and programming level of their jumps.  Impetuous Figures with Combat Jump will have to use their Impetuous Order to perform their jump. If they do not want to jump immediately, at the beginning of the turn they must spend an Order from their army's Orders Reserve in order to stop each impetuous figure from deploying with their Impetuous Order.
