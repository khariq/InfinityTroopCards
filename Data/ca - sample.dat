Morat troops possess an ingrained feeling of belonging to their combat units. Their instruction and training have produced an attack force where an individual sense of duty and personal honour is sublimated to those of the group. The Morat are very strict, follow rules to the letter and will fight until no soldier is on his feet: for this reason they will not disperse until they accomplish their mission. All the Morat have a racial ability equivalent to the Religious Troop Special Skill. In addition, the presence of Morat troops in an army increases the Retreat! threshold from 60% to 75%.
