This term encompasses all devices that vehicles and T.A.G.s use to avoid and neutralize incoming enemy guided projectiles. Standard ECM includes a system of fire detection, localization and proximity radars as well as small battery of micromissiles loaded with nanotechnological chaff. This equipment tampers with the systems of enemy guided projectiles, forcing them to deviate from their target and to explode out of range. ECM from Ariadna are similar to modern ones, although comparatively bigger. Instead of nanotech micromissiles, their ECM systems are equipped with a battery of rockets that create a wall of explosions that detonate enemy guided projectiles. ECM has a standard level of 5, requiring a Normal Roll of 5 or less for each incoming guided projectiles to deflect and detonate the projectile without causing any damage. ECM functions automatically and does not require spending of any Orders or having LoF and can be used in ARO. ECM allows reacting in ARO against enemy guided projectiles.
