To reflect this, Total Reaction allows the firing of the whole Burst (B) of a weapon in ARO. - If the BS roll is a Normal Roll, as many Rolls as the B value of the Weapon will be made. - If the BS roll is a Face to Face Roll, both players will have to make all their BS rolls. All the results (after applying the typical Modifiers) that overcome the best Roll of their adversary will be impacts.

The presence of an EVO Repeater increases the lethal capacity of Hackers, providing a greater power over enemy equipment and systems. In game terms, having an EVO Repeater deployed on the game table allows the Hackers of its army, without spending any additional Orders, to choose between the following different Support Programmes for use when hacking:   Icebreaker: When making a hacking roll, the EVO halves the Biotechnological Shield (BTS) of the target, always rounding up.   Capture: Thanks to the EVO, the Hacker only needs 1 successful WIP Roll to completely possess a T.A.G. and control it in Possessed status (Marker POS). This programme has no effect on T.A.G.s of the Combined Army.   Support Hacking: Up to three Hackers can spend an Order each to give support to a companion. Each Hacker supporting provides a +3 Modifier to the Hacking Roll of the supported figure.Trajectory Assistant: By spending 1 Order the Hacker provides a +3 Modifier to the PH Roll of a figure who is going to perform a Combat Jump. In the case of a Coordinated Combat Jump of various troops dropping all inside the same Circular Template, then it is only necessary for the Hacker to spend a single Order to provide assistance to all of them.   The Hacker must announce, immediately after declaring his Hacking Order, which of the four EVO Support Programmes he is going to use. The EVO Support Programmes are not combinable, not even in Coordinated Order. These Support Programmes cannot be used in ARO.   Hacking Guided Ammunition: In a reactive turn, thanks to the EVO Repeater, a successful Hacking Guided Ammunition action will not only cause a guided munition to miss, but will also jam a Forward Observer's mark on its target. This only disables a Forward Observer's mark as it applies to Guided Ammunition, not for its use in other attacks such as Speculative Fire. This effect lasts until the end of the turn. If a Hacker with an EVO Repeater deployed on the battlefield hacks 1 Guided projectile fired against a figure marked by a Forward Observer, for the rest of the turn he will cause any Guided projectile shot at that miniature to miss automatically. Any further Guided projectile fired against such a figure during that turn will be deflected by the Hacker as an automatic ARO, without any roll necessary. Following a successful Hacking Guided Ammunition roll, a target may be marked again by the same, or another, Forward Observer to allow further Guided projectiles to be fired at it. A new Hacking Guided Ammunition roll is required each and every time the target miniature is marked by another Forward Observer, or again by the same Forward Observer, in order to make Guided Ammunition fired at the target miss.
