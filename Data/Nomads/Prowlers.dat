He will also have chameleonic tools available: photoreactive cells and variable/ combinable environment patterns. These clothing-incorporated systems will merge the miniature with his surroundings. The Special Skill of Camouflage allows its owner to perform:   Camouflaged Deployment: This use is exclusive to the deployment phase and does not require the spending of any Orders or making of rolls. The miniature is not deployed in the usual way: a Camouflage Marker is placed instead. This type of Deployment also allows 3 miniatures (All with the Special Skill of Camouflage) to be deployed under the same Marker. One or more miniatures can be separated from the group at any point in the game, moving as a separate Camouflage Marker. All the figures placed under the Camouflage Marker are revealed if the adversary makes a successful Discover Roll, or if some of the figures perform an Order that uncovers them. When revealed, figures must appear no more than inch of distance from each other, although the player can place them facing however he likes. In game terms, a Camouflage Marker is always the same height as a base troop figure from its own army (Unless it has a Prone Marker beside it).   Camouflage in Movement: This allows the player to move the miniature without placing him on the battlefield. Only his Camouflage Marker will move. When several miniatures are moved under the same Camouflage Marker, they behave as if they were only one miniature. If they have different MOV values, the lowest is always used. The only Skills whose execution does not automatically rreveal the camouflaged figures are Cautious Movement and all Short Skills of Movement that do not require any roll (except Alert). The camouflaged figure reveals automatically when it is in base contact with another figure. If the figure is Discovered or is automatically revealed, the Camouflage Marker is replaced by its miniature (or miniatures), facing how the player prefers. If a Camouflage Marker does not perform anything but MOV in his turn, even if it crosses a Suppression Fire zone or a figure's ZC, the only ARO that can be executed against it is Discover or Change Facing.   Defensive Camouflage: To act against a Camouflage Marker, enemies must succeed in a Discover roll with a -3 Modifier. If the roll is failed, the camouflaged figure is not perceived and may not be a target of BS, CC, or any other Skill (Hacking, Sepsitor, etc.). If the Camouflaged miniature (Or miniatures, if they are clustered) is discovered, it will have to be placed on the battlefield, substituting the Camouflage Maker and losing all the advantages of Camouflage in Movement and Combat, but still complicating any BS Roll against him with a Modifier of -3. When placing the figure over terrain, he can face any direction his owner chooses.   Combat Camouflage: This allows a miniature in a camouflaged state to make a BS, Forward Observer, Sepsitor or Hacking attack before his opponent does. This attack is made with a Normal Roll. If the adversary survives the attack, he may then make any attacks he may have declared in ARO which are also made as Normal Rolls, with -3 to BS if shooting at the revealed figure. After this, the player will have to replace the Camouflage Marker with the correct figure. Combat Camouflage is only available for use with Ballistic Skills. In ARO, the reactions of Camouflaged soldiers are simultaneous to the Order they react to, so Face to Face Rolls will be made. If the Camouflaged figure receives an Intuitive Attack without having been Discovered first, he will have to reveal himself even if he passes the ARM Roll, removing the Camouflage Marker and placing the real figure. In the same way, if he is affected by a Template but the target was another figure, he will have to make an ARM Roll, revealing himself whether he passes the roll or not.   Camouflaging Again: When a figure has lost the Camouflaged status (It is represented by its figure and not a Camouflage Marker), he can recover his former status by spending 1 Order, provided that he is not in the LoF of any enemy miniatures. A figure in TO Camouflage in LoF of a miniature that intends to Camouflage itself again will have to reveal himself if he desires to prevent his enemy from re-entering Camouflaged status.
