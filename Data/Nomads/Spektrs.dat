This is a system that curves the light around its bearer, rendering him almost invisible and erasing his thermal signature. This sophisticated device also diffuses any possible atmospheric turbulence that its bearer may provoke and prevents his detection by radar or sonar. In game terms, TO Camouflage allows its possessor to perform the following:   Hidden Deployment: It allows the same type of deployment as CH: L-2 Camouflage, but there is no need to make use of a Marker. Provided that he does not move, the figure with CH: TO Camouflage will remain completely invisible. The player must take note of his figure's position in the most detailed possible way (Cover, Prone, etc.) so that the adversary will be able to verify the data in the moment in which he reveals his position. If the miniature moves, the player must place a TO Camouflage Marker, and show his adversary that he really was in that position from the beginning of the battle. If the figure performs any other action, he will have to be replaced by the miniature instead of the Marker. A miniature in Hidden Deployment does not add his Order to the Orders Reserve, as he is not on the game table. However, to carry out his first Order, which reveals his presence on the battlefield, he will not receive the Order from the Orders Reserve but will have to spend his own.   Camouflage in Movement: Allows the miniature to carry out the same Camouflaged Movement allowed by CH: Camouflage.   TO Defensive Camouflage: Allows the miniature the same Defensive Camouflage that CH: Camouflage provides, but a negative Modifier of -6 is applied if someone intends to attack him.   TO Combat Camouflage: Allows the same Combat Camouflage as CH: L-2 Camouflage, with no orders needing to be spent.

Forward Observer is a Short Skill. Forward Observers can mark a target, allowing any other miniature on their side without LoF (And with a weapon that allows Speculative Fire or equipped with Guided Special Ammunition) to be able to attack that target at distance. A Forward Observer in LoF with an enemy will be able to mark him after passing a WIP roll (Face to Face, or Normal, depending on the case), modified by Covers, Distance, Camouflage and Hiding Special Skill, or an Optical Disruptor Device. Distance Modifiers for marking with Forward Observer are applied as per the following table: There are two types of attacks that can be made as a result of the marking by a Forward Observer:   Speculative: When the Forward Observer passes his WIP Roll, the target remains marked for any other comrade that wants to shoot at that target, and the Speculative Fire Modifier is not applied.   Guided: When the Forward Observer passes his WIP Roll the target will remain marked for any other comrade possessing a weapon with Guided Ammunition. This figure will be able to use the Short Skill Ballistic Skills to hit the marked miniature without a roll required, as the WIP Roll of the Observer substitutes.   A miniature marked by a Forward Observer will be considered as marked until the end of the turn of the player possessing the Observer that marked it. The special equipment of Forward Observers allows them to use the Flash Pulse.

Placing and activating a Deployable Repeater is a Short Skill, and it must be marked by a Deployable Repeater Marker (REPEATER) placed in base contact with the user. Unlike Mines, it cannot be Camouflaged. Deployable Repeaters have ARM 0, BTS 0, STR 1 and an effective range radius of 8 inches. Each figure with Deployable Repeater carries a total of 3.
