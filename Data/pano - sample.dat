Swiss Guard - HMG	C:\Users\u0064666\Pictures\Cards\ImagesFromCB\PanO\280230-0167-Icon.png	C:\Users\u0064666\Pictures\Cards\ImagesFromCB\PanO\280230-0167.png	C:\Users\u0064666\Pictures\Cards\ImagesFromCB\Regular.png		4-2	15	15	14	13	5	-6	2	1	2	67	CH: TO Camouflage	CH: TO Camouflage	The miniature possesses, besides the Special Skill Camouflage, a Thermo-Optical mimetizing device. This is a system that curves the light around its bearer, rendering him almost invisible and erasing his thermal signature. This sophisticated device also diffuses any possible atmospheric turbulence that its bearer may provoke and prevents his detection by radar or sonar. In game terms, TO Camouflage allows its possessor to perform the following:   Hidden Deployment: It allows the same type of deployment as CH: L-2 Camouflage, but there is no need to make use of a Marker. Provided that he does not move, the figure with CH: TO Camouflage will remain completely invisible. The player must take note of his figure's position in the most detailed possible way (Cover, Prone, etc.) so that the adversary will be able to verify the data in the moment in which he reveals his position. If the miniature moves, the player must place a TO Camouflage Marker, and show his adversary that he really was in that position from the beginning of the battle. If the figure performs any other action, he will have to be replaced by the miniature instead of the Marker. A miniature in Hidden Deployment does not add his Order to the Orders Reserve, as he is not on the game table. However, to carry out his first Order, which reveals his presence on the battlefield, he will not receive the Order from the Orders Reserve but will have to spend his own.   Camouflage in Movement: Allows the miniature to carry out the same Camouflaged Movement allowed by CH: Camouflage.   TO Defensive Camouflage: Allows the miniature the same Defensive Camouflage that CH: Camouflage provides, but a negative Modifier of -6 is applied if someone intends to attack him.   TO Combat Camouflage: Allows the same Combat Camouflage as CH: L-2 Camouflage, with no orders needing to be spent.   Camouflaging again: Functions exactly as CH: L-2 Camouflage			HMG	AP CCW	Pistol
