MediKit	This is a wound recovery medical device carried by all Paramedics. It is used to heal Unconscious miniatures. Using the MediKit is a Short Skill that requires a PH Roll with a -3 Modifier by the patient. If he fails his roll, he will immediately pass to the Dead state and will be removed from the game table. If he passes the roll, the patient recovers 1 Wound, automatically leaving the Unconscious state and contributing his Order again to the Orders Reserve of his army in the next active turn. With a MediKit, miniatures can be healed from the Unconscious state as many times as necessary, provided they pass their PH-3 Rolls. Human MediKits do not work on Aliens (Assault Packs, Dog-Warriors, etc.) and vice versa. The MediKit is the most frequent medical system of nano-injection on battlefields. There are several syringe models; the most modern being a device with the form of a gun, using a chamber with a magnetic coil. After introducing the nanotreatment cartridge and pulling the electric trigger, the magnetic field accelerator injects at high speed the medical nanobots suspended in the cartridge serum. Other versions of the MediKit are the hypo-spray, with a lower speed performance, or the archaic pneumatic pistols.  	Rifle	Knife	Pistol

A Forward Observer in LoF with an enemy will be able to mark him after passing a WIP roll (Face to Face, or Normal, depending on the case), modified by Covers, Distance, Camouflage and Hiding Special Skill, or an Optical Disruptor Device. Distance Modifiers for marking with Forward Observer are applied as per the following table: There are two types of attacks that can be made as a result of the marking by a Forward Observer:   Speculative: When the Forward Observer passes his WIP Roll, the target remains marked for any other comrade that wants to shoot at that target, and the Speculative Fire Modifier is not applied.   Guided: When the Forward Observer passes his WIP Roll the target will remain marked for any other comrade possessing a weapon with Guided Ammunition. This figure will be able to use the Short Skill Ballistic Skills to hit the marked miniature without a roll required, as the WIP Roll of the Observer substitutes.   A miniature marked by a Forward Observer will be considered as marked until the end of the turn of the player possessing the Observer that marked it. The special equipment of Forward Observers allows them to use the Flash Pulse.  			Rifle	Knife	Pistol

He will also have chameleonic tools available: photoreactive cells and variable/ combinable environment patterns. These clothing-incorporated systems will merge the miniature with his surroundings. The Special Skill of Camouflage allows its owner to perform:   Camouflaged Deployment: This use is exclusive to the deployment phase and does not require the spending of any Orders or making of rolls. The miniature is not deployed in the usual way: a Camouflage Marker is placed instead. This type of Deployment also allows 3 miniatures (All with the Special Skill of Camouflage) to be deployed under the same Marker. One or more miniatures can be separated from the group at any point in the game, moving as a separate Camouflage Marker. All the figures placed under the Camouflage Marker are revealed if the adversary makes a successful Discover Roll, or if some of the figures perform an Order that uncovers them. When revealed, figures must appear no more than inch of distance from each other, although the player can place them facing however he likes. In game terms, a Camouflage Marker is always the same height as a base troop figure from its own army (Unless it has a Prone Marker beside it).   Camouflage in Movement: This allows the player to move the miniature without placing him on the battlefield. Only his Camouflage Marker will move. When several miniatures are moved under the same Camouflage Marker, they behave as if they were only one miniature. If they have different MOV values, the lowest is always used. The only Skills whose execution does not automatically rreveal the camouflaged figures are Cautious Movement and all Short Skills of Movement that do not require any roll (except Alert). The camouflaged figure reveals automatically when it is in base contact with another figure. If the figure is Discovered or is automatically revealed, the Camouflage Marker is replaced by its miniature (or miniatures), facing how the player prefers. If a Camouflage Marker does not perform anything but MOV in his turn, even if it crosses a Suppression Fire zone or a figure's ZC, the only ARO that can be executed against it is Discover or Change Facing.   Defensive Camouflage: To act against a Camouflage Marker, enemies must succeed in a Discover roll with a -3 Modifier. If the roll is failed, the camouflaged figure is not perceived and may not be a target of BS, CC, or any other Skill (Hacking, Sepsitor, etc.). If the Camouflaged miniature (Or miniatures, if they are clustered) is discovered, it will have to be placed on the battlefield, substituting the Camouflage Maker and losing all the advantages of Camouflage in Movement and Combat, but still complicating any BS Roll against him with a Modifier of -3. When placing the figure over terrain, he can face any direction his owner chooses.   Combat Camouflage: This allows a miniature in a camouflaged state to make a BS, Forward Observer, Sepsitor or Hacking attack before his opponent does. This attack is made with a Normal Roll. If the adversary survives the attack, he may then make any attacks he may have declared in ARO which are also made as Normal Rolls, with -3 to BS if shooting at the revealed figure. After this, the player will have to replace the Camouflage Marker with the correct figure. Combat Camouflage is only available for use with Ballistic Skills. In ARO, the reactions of Camouflaged soldiers are simultaneous to the Order they react to, so Face to Face Rolls will be made. If the Camouflaged figure receives an Intuitive Attack without having been Discovered first, he will have to reveal himself even if he passes the ARM Roll, removing the Camouflage Marker and placing the real figure. In the same way, if he is affected by a Template but the target was another figure, he will have to make an ARM Roll, revealing himself whether he passes the roll or not.   Camouflaging Again: When a figure has lost the Camouflaged status (It is represented by its figure and not a Camouflage Marker), he can recover his former status by spending 1 Order, provided that he is not in the LoF of any enemy miniatures. A figure in TO Camouflage in LoF of a miniature that intends to Camouflage itself again will have to reveal himself if he desires to prevent his enemy from re-entering Camouflaged status.

One or more miniatures can be separated from the group at any point in the game, moving as a separate Camouflage Marker. All the figures placed under the Camouflage Marker are revealed if the adversary makes a successful Discover Roll, or if some of the figures perform an Order that uncovers them. When revealed, figures must appear no more than inch of distance from each other, although the player can place them facing however he likes. In game terms, a Camouflage Marker is always the same height as a base troop figure from its own army (Unless it has a Prone Marker beside it).   Camouflage in Movement: This allows the player to move the miniature without placing him on the battlefield. Only his Camouflage Marker will move. When several miniatures are moved under the same Camouflage Marker, they behave as if they were only one miniature. If they have different MOV values, the lowest is always used. The only Skills whose execution does not automatically rreveal the camouflaged figures are Cautious Movement and all Short Skills of Movement that do not require any roll (except Alert). The camouflaged figure reveals automatically when it is in base contact with another figure. If the figure is Discovered or is automatically revealed, the Camouflage Marker is replaced by its miniature (or miniatures), facing how the player prefers. If a Camouflage Marker does not perform anything but MOV in his turn, even if it crosses a Suppression Fire zone or a figure's ZC, the only ARO that can be executed against it is Discover or Change Facing.   Defensive Camouflage: To act against a Camouflage Marker, enemies must succeed in a Discover roll with a -3 Modifier. If the roll is failed, the camouflaged figure is not perceived and may not be a target of BS, CC, or any other Skill (Hacking, Sepsitor, etc.). If the Camouflaged miniature (Or miniatures, if they are clustered) is discovered, it will have to be placed on the battlefield, substituting the Camouflage Maker and losing all the advantages of Camouflage in Movement and Combat, but still complicating any BS Roll against him with a Modifier of -3. When placing the figure over terrain, he can face any direction his owner chooses.   Combat Camouflage: This allows a miniature in a camouflaged state to make a BS, Forward Observer, Sepsitor or Hacking attack before his opponent does. This attack is made with a Normal Roll. If the adversary survives the attack, he may then make any attacks he may have declared in ARO which are also made as Normal Rolls, with -3 to BS if shooting at the revealed figure. After this, the player will have to replace the Camouflage Marker with the correct figure. Combat Camouflage is only available for use with Ballistic Skills. In ARO, the reactions of Camouflaged soldiers are simultaneous to the Order they react to, so Face to Face Rolls will be made. If the Camouflaged figure receives an Intuitive Attack without having been Discovered first, he will have to reveal himself even if he passes the ARM Roll, removing the Camouflage Marker and placing the real figure. In the same way, if he is affected by a Template but the target was another figure, he will have to make an ARM Roll, revealing himself whether he passes the roll or not.   Camouflaging Again: When a figure has lost the Camouflaged status (It is represented by its figure and not a Camouflage Marker), he can recover his former status by spending 1 Order, provided that he is not in the LoF of any enemy miniatures. A figure in TO Camouflage in LoF of a miniature that intends to Camouflage itself again will have to reveal himself if he desires to prevent his enemy from re-entering Camouflaged status.

Using the MediKit is a Short Skill that requires a PH Roll with a -3 Modifier by the patient. If he fails his roll, he will immediately pass to the Dead state and will be removed from the game table. If he passes the roll, the patient recovers 1 Wound, automatically leaving the Unconscious state and contributing his Order again to the Orders Reserve of his army in the next active turn. With a MediKit, miniatures can be healed from the Unconscious state as many times as necessary, provided they pass their PH-3 Rolls. Human MediKits do not work on Aliens (Assault Packs, Dog-Warriors, etc.) and vice versa. The MediKit is the most frequent medical system of nano-injection on battlefields. There are several syringe models; the most modern being a device with the form of a gun, using a chamber with a magnetic coil. After introducing the nanotreatment cartridge and pulling the electric trigger, the magnetic field accelerator injects at high speed the medical nanobots suspended in the cartridge serum. Other versions of the MediKit are the hypo-spray, with a lower speed performance, or the archaic pneumatic pistols.  	Rifle	Light Shotgun	CCW	Pistol

MediKit	This is a wound recovery medical device carried by all Paramedics. It is used to heal Unconscious miniatures. Using the MediKit is a Short Skill that requires a PH Roll with a -3 Modifier by the patient. If he fails his roll, he will immediately pass to the Dead state and will be removed from the game table. If he passes the roll, the patient recovers 1 Wound, automatically leaving the Unconscious state and contributing his Order again to the Orders Reserve of his army in the next active turn. With a MediKit, miniatures can be healed from the Unconscious state as many times as necessary, provided they pass their PH-3 Rolls. Human MediKits do not work on Aliens (Assault Packs, Dog-Warriors, etc.) and vice versa. The MediKit is the most frequent medical system of nano-injection on battlefields. There are several syringe models; the most modern being a device with the form of a gun, using a chamber with a magnetic coil. After introducing the nanotreatment cartridge and pulling the electric trigger, the magnetic field accelerator injects at high speed the medical nanobots suspended in the cartridge serum. Other versions of the MediKit are the hypo-spray, with a lower speed performance, or the archaic pneumatic pistols.  	Rifle	Light Shotgun	CCW	Pistol

He will also have chameleonic tools available: photoreactive cells and variable/ combinable environment patterns. These clothing-incorporated systems will merge the miniature with his surroundings. The Special Skill of Camouflage allows its owner to perform:   Camouflaged Deployment: This use is exclusive to the deployment phase and does not require the spending of any Orders or making of rolls. The miniature is not deployed in the usual way: a Camouflage Marker is placed instead. This type of Deployment also allows 3 miniatures (All with the Special Skill of Camouflage) to be deployed under the same Marker. One or more miniatures can be separated from the group at any point in the game, moving as a separate Camouflage Marker. All the figures placed under the Camouflage Marker are revealed if the adversary makes a successful Discover Roll, or if some of the figures perform an Order that uncovers them. When revealed, figures must appear no more than inch of distance from each other, although the player can place them facing however he likes. In game terms, a Camouflage Marker is always the same height as a base troop figure from its own army (Unless it has a Prone Marker beside it).   Camouflage in Movement: This allows the player to move the miniature without placing him on the battlefield. Only his Camouflage Marker will move. When several miniatures are moved under the same Camouflage Marker, they behave as if they were only one miniature. If they have different MOV values, the lowest is always used. The only Skills whose execution does not automatically rreveal the camouflaged figures are Cautious Movement and all Short Skills of Movement that do not require any roll (except Alert). The camouflaged figure reveals automatically when it is in base contact with another figure. If the figure is Discovered or is automatically revealed, the Camouflage Marker is replaced by its miniature (or miniatures), facing how the player prefers. If a Camouflage Marker does not perform anything but MOV in his turn, even if it crosses a Suppression Fire zone or a figure's ZC, the only ARO that can be executed against it is Discover or Change Facing.   Defensive Camouflage: To act against a Camouflage Marker, enemies must succeed in a Discover roll with a -3 Modifier. If the roll is failed, the camouflaged figure is not perceived and may not be a target of BS, CC, or any other Skill (Hacking, Sepsitor, etc.). If the Camouflaged miniature (Or miniatures, if they are clustered) is discovered, it will have to be placed on the battlefield, substituting the Camouflage Maker and losing all the advantages of Camouflage in Movement and Combat, but still complicating any BS Roll against him with a Modifier of -3. When placing the figure over terrain, he can face any direction his owner chooses.   Combat Camouflage: This allows a miniature in a camouflaged state to make a BS, Forward Observer, Sepsitor or Hacking attack before his opponent does. This attack is made with a Normal Roll. If the adversary survives the attack, he may then make any attacks he may have declared in ARO which are also made as Normal Rolls, with -3 to BS if shooting at the revealed figure. After this, the player will have to replace the Camouflage Marker with the correct figure. Combat Camouflage is only available for use with Ballistic Skills. In ARO, the reactions of Camouflaged soldiers are simultaneous to the Order they react to, so Face to Face Rolls will be made. If the Camouflaged figure receives an Intuitive Attack without having been Discovered first, he will have to reveal himself even if he passes the ARM Roll, removing the Camouflage Marker and placing the real figure. In the same way, if he is affected by a Template but the target was another figure, he will have to make an ARM Roll, revealing himself whether he passes the roll or not.   Camouflaging Again: When a figure has lost the Camouflaged status (It is represented by its figure and not a Camouflage Marker), he can recover his former status by spending 1 Order, provided that he is not in the LoF of any enemy miniatures. A figure in TO Camouflage in LoF of a miniature that intends to Camouflage itself again will have to reveal himself if he desires to prevent his enemy from re-entering Camouflaged status.	 Infiltration	Due to his ability to move stealthily, the miniature will be able to infiltrate the enemy's lines without being noticed. The use of the Infiltrate Special Skill is only allowed in the Deployment Phase. Infiltration allows a miniature the following options:   Option A: The miniature can be deployed, without having to spend an Order or make a Roll, up to the central area of the game table (within the half corresponding to his army). He is deployed in Camouflage or TO Camouflage status if applicable.   Option B: If the miniature wants to go further into enemy territory, he must to pass a Normal Roll of PH. Each 4 inch strip of distance advanced into enemy territory will add a cumulative Modifier of -1 to the roll. If he fails the roll, the Dispersion rule must now be applied. The centre of the Circular Template must be placed at the point in the battlefield where the figure wished to Infiltrate, with the number 1 pointing to the centre of the game table, multiplying the Failure Category by 2.5 (FC x 2.5) to determine where to place the infiltrator. Moreover, the miniature will lose the Camouflaged Deployment and Hidden Deployment options provided by the CH: Camouflage and CH: TO Camouflage Special Skills.   It is not allowed to Infiltrate inside the enemy's Zone of Deployment, or in base contact with another figure. If Dispersion would place the miniature in either position, move the figure back towards its initial Infiltration point until it is no longer in an illegal position; ie. the figure will be placed on the limit of the enemy's Zone of Deployment closest to the initial Infiltration point.

A Forward Observer in LoF with an enemy will be able to mark him after passing a WIP roll (Face to Face, or Normal, depending on the case), modified by Covers, Distance, Camouflage and Hiding Special Skill, or an Optical Disruptor Device. Distance Modifiers for marking with Forward Observer are applied as per the following table: There are two types of attacks that can be made as a result of the marking by a Forward Observer:   Speculative: When the Forward Observer passes his WIP Roll, the target remains marked for any other comrade that wants to shoot at that target, and the Speculative Fire Modifier is not applied.   Guided: When the Forward Observer passes his WIP Roll the target will remain marked for any other comrade possessing a weapon with Guided Ammunition. This figure will be able to use the Short Skill Ballistic Skills to hit the marked miniature without a roll required, as the WIP Roll of the Observer substitutes.   A miniature marked by a Forward Observer will be considered as marked until the end of the turn of the player possessing the Observer that marked it. The special equipment of Forward Observers allows them to use the Flash Pulse.  	 CH: Camouflage	The miniature has a special capacity, be it natural or learned, for hiding and stealth. He will also have chameleonic tools available: photoreactive cells and variable/ combinable environment patterns. These clothing-incorporated systems will merge the miniature with his surroundings. The Special Skill of Camouflage allows its owner to perform:   Camouflaged Deployment: This use is exclusive to the deployment phase and does not require the spending of any Orders or making of rolls. The miniature is not deployed in the usual way: a Camouflage Marker is placed instead. This type of Deployment also allows 3 miniatures (All with the Special Skill of Camouflage) to be deployed under the same Marker. One or more miniatures can be separated from the group at any point in the game, moving as a separate Camouflage Marker. All the figures placed under the Camouflage Marker are revealed if the adversary makes a successful Discover Roll, or if some of the figures perform an Order that uncovers them. When revealed, figures must appear no more than inch of distance from each other, although the player can place them facing however he likes. In game terms, a Camouflage Marker is always the same height as a base troop figure from its own army (Unless it has a Prone Marker beside it).   Camouflage in Movement: This allows the player to move the miniature without placing him on the battlefield. Only his Camouflage Marker will move. When several miniatures are moved under the same Camouflage Marker, they behave as if they were only one miniature. If they have different MOV values, the lowest is always used. The only Skills whose execution does not automatically rreveal the camouflaged figures are Cautious Movement and all Short Skills of Movement that do not require any roll (except Alert). The camouflaged figure reveals automatically when it is in base contact with another figure. If the figure is Discovered or is automatically revealed, the Camouflage Marker is replaced by its miniature (or miniatures), facing how the player prefers. If a Camouflage Marker does not perform anything but MOV in his turn, even if it crosses a Suppression Fire zone or a figure's ZC, the only ARO that can be executed against it is Discover or Change Facing.   Defensive Camouflage: To act against a Camouflage Marker, enemies must succeed in a Discover roll with a -3 Modifier. If the roll is failed, the camouflaged figure is not perceived and may not be a target of BS, CC, or any other Skill (Hacking, Sepsitor, etc.). If the Camouflaged miniature (Or miniatures, if they are clustered) is discovered, it will have to be placed on the battlefield, substituting the Camouflage Maker and losing all the advantages of Camouflage in Movement and Combat, but still complicating any BS Roll against him with a Modifier of -3. When placing the figure over terrain, he can face any direction his owner chooses.   Combat Camouflage: This allows a miniature in a camouflaged state to make a BS, Forward Observer, Sepsitor or Hacking attack before his opponent does. This attack is made with a Normal Roll. If the adversary survives the attack, he may then make any attacks he may have declared in ARO which are also made as Normal Rolls, with -3 to BS if shooting at the revealed figure. After this, the player will have to replace the Camouflage Marker with the correct figure. Combat Camouflage is only available for use with Ballistic Skills. In ARO, the reactions of Camouflaged soldiers are simultaneous to the Order they react to, so Face to Face Rolls will be made. If the Camouflaged figure receives an Intuitive Attack without having been Discovered first, he will have to reveal himself even if he passes the ARM Roll, removing the Camouflage Marker and placing the real figure. In the same way, if he is affected by a Template but the target was another figure, he will have to make an ARM Roll, revealing himself whether he passes the roll or not.   Camouflaging Again: When a figure has lost the Camouflaged status (It is represented by its figure and not a Camouflage Marker), he can recover his former status by spending 1 Order, provided that he is not in the LoF of any enemy miniatures. A figure in TO Camouflage in LoF of a miniature that intends to Camouflage itself again will have to reveal himself if he desires to prevent his enemy from re-entering Camouflaged status.

Each 4 inch strip of distance advanced into enemy territory will add a cumulative Modifier of -1 to the roll. If he fails the roll, the Dispersion rule must now be applied.

If a Camouflage Marker does not perform anything but MOV in his turn, even if it crosses a Suppression Fire zone or a figure's ZC, the only ARO that can be executed against it is Discover or Change Facing.   Defensive Camouflage: To act against a Camouflage Marker, enemies must succeed in a Discover roll with a -3 Modifier. If the roll is failed, the camouflaged figure is not perceived and may not be a target of BS, CC, or any other Skill (Hacking, Sepsitor, etc.). If the Camouflaged miniature (Or miniatures, if they are clustered) is discovered, it will have to be placed on the battlefield, substituting the Camouflage Maker and losing all the advantages of Camouflage in Movement and Combat, but still complicating any BS Roll against him with a Modifier of -3. When placing the figure over terrain, he can face any direction his owner chooses.   Combat Camouflage: This allows a miniature in a camouflaged state to make a BS, Forward Observer, Sepsitor or Hacking attack before his opponent does. This attack is made with a Normal Roll. If the adversary survives the attack, he may then make any attacks he may have declared in ARO which are also made as Normal Rolls, with -3 to BS if shooting at the revealed figure. After this, the player will have to replace the Camouflage Marker with the correct figure. Combat Camouflage is only available for use with Ballistic Skills. In ARO, the reactions of Camouflaged soldiers are simultaneous to the Order they react to, so Face to Face Rolls will be made. If the Camouflaged figure receives an Intuitive Attack without having been Discovered first, he will have to reveal himself even if he passes the ARM Roll, removing the Camouflage Marker and placing the real figure. In the same way, if he is affected by a Template but the target was another figure, he will have to make an ARM Roll, revealing himself whether he passes the roll or not.   Camouflaging Again: When a figure has lost the Camouflaged status (It is represented by its figure and not a Camouflage Marker), he can recover his former status by spending 1 Order, provided that he is not in the LoF of any enemy miniatures. A figure in TO Camouflage in LoF of a miniature that intends to Camouflage itself again will have to reveal himself if he desires to prevent his enemy from re-entering Camouflaged status.	 Infiltration	Due to his ability to move stealthily, the miniature will be able to infiltrate the enemy's lines without being noticed. The use of the Infiltrate Special Skill is only allowed in the Deployment Phase. Infiltration allows a miniature the following options:   Option A: The miniature can be deployed, without having to spend an Order or make a Roll, up to the central area of the game table (within the half corresponding to his army). He is deployed in Camouflage or TO Camouflage status if applicable.   Option B: If the miniature wants to go further into enemy territory, he must to pass a Normal Roll of PH. Each 4 inch strip of distance advanced into enemy territory will add a cumulative Modifier of -1 to the roll. If he fails the roll, the Dispersion rule must now be applied. The centre of the Circular Template must be placed at the point in the battlefield where the figure wished to Infiltrate, with the number 1 pointing to the centre of the game table, multiplying the Failure Category by 2.5 (FC x 2.5) to determine where to place the infiltrator. Moreover, the miniature will lose the Camouflaged Deployment and Hidden Deployment options provided by the CH: Camouflage and CH: TO Camouflage Special Skills.   It is not allowed to Infiltrate inside the enemy's Zone of Deployment, or in base contact with another figure. If Dispersion would place the miniature in either position, move the figure back towards its initial Infiltration point until it is no longer in an illegal position; ie. the figure will be placed on the limit of the enemy's Zone of Deployment closest to the initial Infiltration point.

Guided: When the Forward Observer passes his WIP Roll the target will remain marked for any other comrade possessing a weapon with Guided Ammunition.

Infiltration allows a miniature the following options:   Option A: The miniature can be deployed, without having to spend an Order or make a Roll, up to the central area of the game table (within the half corresponding to his army). He is deployed in Camouflage or TO Camouflage status if applicable.   Option B: If the miniature wants to go further into enemy territory, he must to pass a Normal Roll of PH. Each 4 inch strip of distance advanced into enemy territory will add a cumulative Modifier of -1 to the roll. If he fails the roll, the Dispersion rule must now be applied. The centre of the Circular Template must be placed at the point in the battlefield where the figure wished to Infiltrate, with the number 1 pointing to the centre of the game table, multiplying the Failure Category by 2.5 (FC x 2.5) to determine where to place the infiltrator. Moreover, the miniature will lose the Camouflaged Deployment and Hidden Deployment options provided by the CH: Camouflage and CH: TO Camouflage Special Skills.   It is not allowed to Infiltrate inside the enemy's Zone of Deployment, or in base contact with another figure. If Dispersion would place the miniature in either position, move the figure back towards its initial Infiltration point until it is no longer in an illegal position; ie. the figure will be placed on the limit of the enemy's Zone of Deployment closest to the initial Infiltration point.

He will also have chameleonic tools available: photoreactive cells and variable/ combinable environment patterns. These clothing-incorporated systems will merge the miniature with his surroundings. The Special Skill of Camouflage allows its owner to perform:   Camouflaged Deployment: This use is exclusive to the deployment phase and does not require the spending of any Orders or making of rolls. The miniature is not deployed in the usual way: a Camouflage Marker is placed instead. This type of Deployment also allows 3 miniatures (All with the Special Skill of Camouflage) to be deployed under the same Marker. One or more miniatures can be separated from the group at any point in the game, moving as a separate Camouflage Marker. All the figures placed under the Camouflage Marker are revealed if the adversary makes a successful Discover Roll, or if some of the figures perform an Order that uncovers them. When revealed, figures must appear no more than inch of distance from each other, although the player can place them facing however he likes. In game terms, a Camouflage Marker is always the same height as a base troop figure from its own army (Unless it has a Prone Marker beside it).   Camouflage in Movement: This allows the player to move the miniature without placing him on the battlefield. Only his Camouflage Marker will move. When several miniatures are moved under the same Camouflage Marker, they behave as if they were only one miniature. If they have different MOV values, the lowest is always used. The only Skills whose execution does not automatically rreveal the camouflaged figures are Cautious Movement and all Short Skills of Movement that do not require any roll (except Alert). The camouflaged figure reveals automatically when it is in base contact with another figure. If the figure is Discovered or is automatically revealed, the Camouflage Marker is replaced by its miniature (or miniatures), facing how the player prefers. If a Camouflage Marker does not perform anything but MOV in his turn, even if it crosses a Suppression Fire zone or a figure's ZC, the only ARO that can be executed against it is Discover or Change Facing.   Defensive Camouflage: To act against a Camouflage Marker, enemies must succeed in a Discover roll with a -3 Modifier. If the roll is failed, the camouflaged figure is not perceived and may not be a target of BS, CC, or any other Skill (Hacking, Sepsitor, etc.). If the Camouflaged miniature (Or miniatures, if they are clustered) is discovered, it will have to be placed on the battlefield, substituting the Camouflage Maker and losing all the advantages of Camouflage in Movement and Combat, but still complicating any BS Roll against him with a Modifier of -3. When placing the figure over terrain, he can face any direction his owner chooses.   Combat Camouflage: This allows a miniature in a camouflaged state to make a BS, Forward Observer, Sepsitor or Hacking attack before his opponent does. This attack is made with a Normal Roll. If the adversary survives the attack, he may then make any attacks he may have declared in ARO which are also made as Normal Rolls, with -3 to BS if shooting at the revealed figure. After this, the player will have to replace the Camouflage Marker with the correct figure. Combat Camouflage is only available for use with Ballistic Skills. In ARO, the reactions of Camouflaged soldiers are simultaneous to the Order they react to, so Face to Face Rolls will be made. If the Camouflaged figure receives an Intuitive Attack without having been Discovered first, he will have to reveal himself even if he passes the ARM Roll, removing the Camouflage Marker and placing the real figure. In the same way, if he is affected by a Template but the target was another figure, he will have to make an ARM Roll, revealing himself whether he passes the roll or not.   Camouflaging Again: When a figure has lost the Camouflaged status (It is represented by its figure and not a Camouflage Marker), he can recover his former status by spending 1 Order, provided that he is not in the LoF of any enemy miniatures. A figure in TO Camouflage in LoF of a miniature that intends to Camouflage itself again will have to reveal himself if he desires to prevent his enemy from re-entering Camouflaged status.

Distance Modifiers for marking with Forward Observer are applied as per the following table: There are two types of attacks that can be made as a result of the marking by a Forward Observer:   Speculative: When the Forward Observer passes his WIP Roll, the target remains marked for any other comrade that wants to shoot at that target, and the Speculative Fire Modifier is not applied.   Guided: When the Forward Observer passes his WIP Roll the target will remain marked for any other comrade possessing a weapon with Guided Ammunition. This figure will be able to use the Short Skill Ballistic Skills to hit the marked miniature without a roll required, as the WIP Roll of the Observer substitutes.   A miniature marked by a Forward Observer will be considered as marked until the end of the turn of the player possessing the Observer that marked it.

One or more miniatures can be separated from the group at any point in the game, moving as a separate Camouflage Marker. All the figures placed under the Camouflage Marker are revealed if the adversary makes a successful Discover Roll, or if some of the figures perform an Order that uncovers them. When revealed, figures must appear no more than inch of distance from each other, although the player can place them facing however he likes. In game terms, a Camouflage Marker is always the same height as a base troop figure from its own army (Unless it has a Prone Marker beside it).   Camouflage in Movement: This allows the player to move the miniature without placing him on the battlefield. Only his Camouflage Marker will move. When several miniatures are moved under the same Camouflage Marker, they behave as if they were only one miniature. If they have different MOV values, the lowest is always used. The only Skills whose execution does not automatically rreveal the camouflaged figures are Cautious Movement and all Short Skills of Movement that do not require any roll (except Alert). The camouflaged figure reveals automatically when it is in base contact with another figure. If the figure is Discovered or is automatically revealed, the Camouflage Marker is replaced by its miniature (or miniatures), facing how the player prefers. If a Camouflage Marker does not perform anything but MOV in his turn, even if it crosses a Suppression Fire zone or a figure's ZC, the only ARO that can be executed against it is Discover or Change Facing.   Defensive Camouflage: To act against a Camouflage Marker, enemies must succeed in a Discover roll with a -3 Modifier. If the roll is failed, the camouflaged figure is not perceived and may not be a target of BS, CC, or any other Skill (Hacking, Sepsitor, etc.). If the Camouflaged miniature (Or miniatures, if they are clustered) is discovered, it will have to be placed on the battlefield, substituting the Camouflage Maker and losing all the advantages of Camouflage in Movement and Combat, but still complicating any BS Roll against him with a Modifier of -3. When placing the figure over terrain, he can face any direction his owner chooses.   Combat Camouflage: This allows a miniature in a camouflaged state to make a BS, Forward Observer, Sepsitor or Hacking attack before his opponent does. This attack is made with a Normal Roll. If the adversary survives the attack, he may then make any attacks he may have declared in ARO which are also made as Normal Rolls, with -3 to BS if shooting at the revealed figure. After this, the player will have to replace the Camouflage Marker with the correct figure. Combat Camouflage is only available for use with Ballistic Skills. In ARO, the reactions of Camouflaged soldiers are simultaneous to the Order they react to, so Face to Face Rolls will be made. If the Camouflaged figure receives an Intuitive Attack without having been Discovered first, he will have to reveal himself even if he passes the ARM Roll, removing the Camouflage Marker and placing the real figure. In the same way, if he is affected by a Template but the target was another figure, he will have to make an ARM Roll, revealing himself whether he passes the roll or not.   Camouflaging Again: When a figure has lost the Camouflaged status (It is represented by its figure and not a Camouflage Marker), he can recover his former status by spending 1 Order, provided that he is not in the LoF of any enemy miniatures. A figure in TO Camouflage in LoF of a miniature that intends to Camouflage itself again will have to reveal himself if he desires to prevent his enemy from re-entering Camouflaged status.	 Infiltration	Due to his ability to move stealthily, the miniature will be able to infiltrate the enemy's lines without being noticed. The use of the Infiltrate Special Skill is only allowed in the Deployment Phase. Infiltration allows a miniature the following options:   Option A: The miniature can be deployed, without having to spend an Order or make a Roll, up to the central area of the game table (within the half corresponding to his army). He is deployed in Camouflage or TO Camouflage status if applicable.   Option B: If the miniature wants to go further into enemy territory, he must to pass a Normal Roll of PH. Each 4 inch strip of distance advanced into enemy territory will add a cumulative Modifier of -1 to the roll. If he fails the roll, the Dispersion rule must now be applied. The centre of the Circular Template must be placed at the point in the battlefield where the figure wished to Infiltrate, with the number 1 pointing to the centre of the game table, multiplying the Failure Category by 2.5 (FC x 2.5) to determine where to place the infiltrator. Moreover, the miniature will lose the Camouflaged Deployment and Hidden Deployment options provided by the CH: Camouflage and CH: TO Camouflage Special Skills.   It is not allowed to Infiltrate inside the enemy's Zone of Deployment, or in base contact with another figure. If Dispersion would place the miniature in either position, move the figure back towards its initial Infiltration point until it is no longer in an illegal position; ie. the figure will be placed on the limit of the enemy's Zone of Deployment closest to the initial Infiltration point.

Engineers can reactivate all weapons, equipment and armour affected by E/M and Adhesive Special Ammunition if they they pass 1 single Normal WIP Roll when in contact with the affected figure.

Three Antipodes are necessary to compose an intelligent entity, creating one personality with each individual contributing diverse characteristics. For this reason, it costs only 1 Order to activate an Assault Pack of three Antipodes. All the Antipodes in the Pack will then perform the same Skills simultaneously, but make separate rolls to resolve actions. Members of a Pack, in ARO as well as in their own turn, behave always as if they were only one figure. Although they can move in separate ways, they must execute the same Skills in a sole Order and choose the same target, providing only one ARO to enemy miniatures, as with standard Coordinated Orders. When a member of a Pack falls, the Antipode group identity suffers a mutilation of its reasoning capacity, with the WIP of each Antipode reduced by -3 for every lost member of the Pack. The Ariadnians have managed to work with Packs of 3 and 4 members, to increase their resistance capacity. If the Assault Pack belongs to an Ariadnian army and they lose their Controller or his Control Device is Disabled, they must make a WIP Roll. If the roll is successful, they continue with the last orders received by the Controller, which usually consists of charging against the enemy. In such a situation, the Pack is still considered as part of the Ariadnian army. If they fail the roll, they must make a d20 roll. With a result of 10 or less, the Pack will use its respective Orders (Impetuous and normal Order) to get off the table through the nearest edge, performing no orders except for Move or Dodge. If the result is over 10, the Pack will enter Frenzy state and go bananas, leaving the control of the Ariadnian player. In the following game rounds, the Antipodes will act before the rest of the players, using their Impetuous Order and their own Order to attack the nearest figure, continuing every turn until either they or all other miniatures on the table are dead. They attack the nearest figure each turn, whether friend or foe. Every time after the Controller's disappearance the Pack loses one of its members, a WIP roll must be made with the corresponding Modifier per dead Antipode, with results as above. When organizing Groups in an army, the Pack and their Controller will count as two figures and will always be in the same Group. The Pack gives 1 single Order to the Order Reserve, different from the Order given by their Controller.  	 CH: Camouflage	The miniature has a special capacity, be it natural or learned, for hiding and stealth. He will also have chameleonic tools available: photoreactive cells and variable/ combinable environment patterns. These clothing-incorporated systems will merge the miniature with his surroundings. The Special Skill of Camouflage allows its owner to perform:   Camouflaged Deployment: This use is exclusive to the deployment phase and does not require the spending of any Orders or making of rolls. The miniature is not deployed in the usual way: a Camouflage Marker is placed instead. This type of Deployment also allows 3 miniatures (All with the Special Skill of Camouflage) to be deployed under the same Marker. One or more miniatures can be separated from the group at any point in the game, moving as a separate Camouflage Marker. All the figures placed under the Camouflage Marker are revealed if the adversary makes a successful Discover Roll, or if some of the figures perform an Order that uncovers them. When revealed, figures must appear no more than inch of distance from each other, although the player can place them facing however he likes. In game terms, a Camouflage Marker is always the same height as a base troop figure from its own army (Unless it has a Prone Marker beside it).   Camouflage in Movement: This allows the player to move the miniature without placing him on the battlefield. Only his Camouflage Marker will move. When several miniatures are moved under the same Camouflage Marker, they behave as if they were only one miniature. If they have different MOV values, the lowest is always used. The only Skills whose execution does not automatically rreveal the camouflaged figures are Cautious Movement and all Short Skills of Movement that do not require any roll (except Alert). The camouflaged figure reveals automatically when it is in base contact with another figure. If the figure is Discovered or is automatically revealed, the Camouflage Marker is replaced by its miniature (or miniatures), facing how the player prefers. If a Camouflage Marker does not perform anything but MOV in his turn, even if it crosses a Suppression Fire zone or a figure's ZC, the only ARO that can be executed against it is Discover or Change Facing.   Defensive Camouflage: To act against a Camouflage Marker, enemies must succeed in a Discover roll with a -3 Modifier. If the roll is failed, the camouflaged figure is not perceived and may not be a target of BS, CC, or any other Skill (Hacking, Sepsitor, etc.). If the Camouflaged miniature (Or miniatures, if they are clustered) is discovered, it will have to be placed on the battlefield, substituting the Camouflage Maker and losing all the advantages of Camouflage in Movement and Combat, but still complicating any BS Roll against him with a Modifier of -3. When placing the figure over terrain, he can face any direction his owner chooses.   Combat Camouflage: This allows a miniature in a camouflaged state to make a BS, Forward Observer, Sepsitor or Hacking attack before his opponent does. This attack is made with a Normal Roll. If the adversary survives the attack, he may then make any attacks he may have declared in ARO which are also made as Normal Rolls, with -3 to BS if shooting at the revealed figure. After this, the player will have to replace the Camouflage Marker with the correct figure. Combat Camouflage is only available for use with Ballistic Skills. In ARO, the reactions of Camouflaged soldiers are simultaneous to the Order they react to, so Face to Face Rolls will be made. If the Camouflaged figure receives an Intuitive Attack without having been Discovered first, he will have to reveal himself even if he passes the ARM Roll, removing the Camouflage Marker and placing the real figure. In the same way, if he is affected by a Template but the target was another figure, he will have to make an ARM Roll, revealing himself whether he passes the roll or not.   Camouflaging Again: When a figure has lost the Camouflaged status (It is represented by its figure and not a Camouflage Marker), he can recover his former status by spending 1 Order, provided that he is not in the LoF of any enemy miniatures. A figure in TO Camouflage in LoF of a miniature that intends to Camouflage itself again will have to reveal himself if he desires to prevent his enemy from re-entering Camouflaged status.

A miniature that has been healed can also benefit later from a MediKit, AutoMediKit, or Regeneration, and vice versa. A figure must be in base to base contact with a patient to use the Doctor Special Skill.

If he fails the WIP Roll, the figure is considered to be Dead and is removed from the game table. Miniatures can be healed as many times as necessary, provided that the WIP rolls are successful. A miniature that has been healed can also benefit later from a MediKit, AutoMediKit, or Regeneration, and vice versa. A figure must be in base to base contact with a patient to use the Doctor Special Skill. A Doctor with the Special Skill V: No Wound Incapacitation who has suffered one Wound can try to heal himself but if he fails the WIP roll he will die automatically.  	 V: Courage	Courage avoids, without spending any Order, the WIP Roll that is compulsory after surviving the impact of a ballistic weapon but the figure does not wish to move to cover (The Guts Roll made after a successful ARM Roll). The figure is not required to keep his position if he does not want to.  	Light Shotgun	CCW	Pistol

This Special Skill works automatically. It allows the miniature to move in a vertical, diagonal, or horizontal jump as many inches as indicated in his MOV, without having to make a PH Roll. Super-Jump is a Special Short Movement Skill that can be combined with other Short Skills. For example, with Super-Jump, the figure can shoot while flying through the air and this will be considered an Order of the Move+BS type. Also, when the miniature moves in a normal way he will be able to avoid any obstacle of his height or less without any Movement restriction. To calculate the Falling Damage taken by miniatures with SuperJump, the sum of both values of his MOV Attribute is subtracted from the distance and the result multiplied by 2.5. For example: a miniature with Super-Jump with MOV 4-4, that jumps from a terrace to the floor from a height of 10 inches will only have to make an ARM Roll against Damage 5 (distance of 10 minus MOV 4+4 = 2, multiplied by 2.5 to give 5).  	 Total Immunity	Total Immunity: The miniature is immune to all the special Weapons and Ammunition (Except Adhesive, E/M, Monofilament and Plasma), which are considered as normal attacks.

In addition, the Dogged Special Skill includes also the Courage Special Skill. Dogged cannot be used in ARO.

MediKit	This is a wound recovery medical device carried by all Paramedics. It is used to heal Unconscious miniatures. Using the MediKit is a Short Skill that requires a PH Roll with a -3 Modifier by the patient. If he fails his roll, he will immediately pass to the Dead state and will be removed from the game table. If he passes the roll, the patient recovers 1 Wound, automatically leaving the Unconscious state and contributing his Order again to the Orders Reserve of his army in the next active turn. With a MediKit, miniatures can be healed from the Unconscious state as many times as necessary, provided they pass their PH-3 Rolls. Human MediKits do not work on Aliens (Assault Packs, Dog-Warriors, etc.) and vice versa. The MediKit is the most frequent medical system of nano-injection on battlefields. There are several syringe models; the most modern being a device with the form of a gun, using a chamber with a magnetic coil. After introducing the nanotreatment cartridge and pulling the electric trigger, the magnetic field accelerator injects at high speed the medical nanobots suspended in the cartridge serum. Other versions of the MediKit are the hypo-spray, with a lower speed performance, or the archaic pneumatic pistols.  	Rifle	Knife	Pistol

A Forward Observer in LoF with an enemy will be able to mark him after passing a WIP roll (Face to Face, or Normal, depending on the case), modified by Covers, Distance, Camouflage and Hiding Special Skill, or an Optical Disruptor Device. Distance Modifiers for marking with Forward Observer are applied as per the following table: There are two types of attacks that can be made as a result of the marking by a Forward Observer:   Speculative: When the Forward Observer passes his WIP Roll, the target remains marked for any other comrade that wants to shoot at that target, and the Speculative Fire Modifier is not applied.   Guided: When the Forward Observer passes his WIP Roll the target will remain marked for any other comrade possessing a weapon with Guided Ammunition. This figure will be able to use the Short Skill Ballistic Skills to hit the marked miniature without a roll required, as the WIP Roll of the Observer substitutes.   A miniature marked by a Forward Observer will be considered as marked until the end of the turn of the player possessing the Observer that marked it. The special equipment of Forward Observers allows them to use the Flash Pulse.  	 CH: Camouflage	The miniature has a special capacity, be it natural or learned, for hiding and stealth. He will also have chameleonic tools available: photoreactive cells and variable/ combinable environment patterns. These clothing-incorporated systems will merge the miniature with his surroundings. The Special Skill of Camouflage allows its owner to perform:   Camouflaged Deployment: This use is exclusive to the deployment phase and does not require the spending of any Orders or making of rolls. The miniature is not deployed in the usual way: a Camouflage Marker is placed instead. This type of Deployment also allows 3 miniatures (All with the Special Skill of Camouflage) to be deployed under the same Marker. One or more miniatures can be separated from the group at any point in the game, moving as a separate Camouflage Marker. All the figures placed under the Camouflage Marker are revealed if the adversary makes a successful Discover Roll, or if some of the figures perform an Order that uncovers them. When revealed, figures must appear no more than inch of distance from each other, although the player can place them facing however he likes. In game terms, a Camouflage Marker is always the same height as a base troop figure from its own army (Unless it has a Prone Marker beside it).   Camouflage in Movement: This allows the player to move the miniature without placing him on the battlefield. Only his Camouflage Marker will move. When several miniatures are moved under the same Camouflage Marker, they behave as if they were only one miniature. If they have different MOV values, the lowest is always used. The only Skills whose execution does not automatically rreveal the camouflaged figures are Cautious Movement and all Short Skills of Movement that do not require any roll (except Alert). The camouflaged figure reveals automatically when it is in base contact with another figure. If the figure is Discovered or is automatically revealed, the Camouflage Marker is replaced by its miniature (or miniatures), facing how the player prefers. If a Camouflage Marker does not perform anything but MOV in his turn, even if it crosses a Suppression Fire zone or a figure's ZC, the only ARO that can be executed against it is Discover or Change Facing.   Defensive Camouflage: To act against a Camouflage Marker, enemies must succeed in a Discover roll with a -3 Modifier. If the roll is failed, the camouflaged figure is not perceived and may not be a target of BS, CC, or any other Skill (Hacking, Sepsitor, etc.). If the Camouflaged miniature (Or miniatures, if they are clustered) is discovered, it will have to be placed on the battlefield, substituting the Camouflage Maker and losing all the advantages of Camouflage in Movement and Combat, but still complicating any BS Roll against him with a Modifier of -3. When placing the figure over terrain, he can face any direction his owner chooses.   Combat Camouflage: This allows a miniature in a camouflaged state to make a BS, Forward Observer, Sepsitor or Hacking attack before his opponent does. This attack is made with a Normal Roll. If the adversary survives the attack, he may then make any attacks he may have declared in ARO which are also made as Normal Rolls, with -3 to BS if shooting at the revealed figure. After this, the player will have to replace the Camouflage Marker with the correct figure. Combat Camouflage is only available for use with Ballistic Skills. In ARO, the reactions of Camouflaged soldiers are simultaneous to the Order they react to, so Face to Face Rolls will be made. If the Camouflaged figure receives an Intuitive Attack without having been Discovered first, he will have to reveal himself even if he passes the ARM Roll, removing the Camouflage Marker and placing the real figure. In the same way, if he is affected by a Template but the target was another figure, he will have to make an ARM Roll, revealing himself whether he passes the roll or not.   Camouflaging Again: When a figure has lost the Camouflaged status (It is represented by its figure and not a Camouflage Marker), he can recover his former status by spending 1 Order, provided that he is not in the LoF of any enemy miniatures. A figure in TO Camouflage in LoF of a miniature that intends to Camouflage itself again will have to reveal himself if he desires to prevent his enemy from re-entering Camouflaged status.

During Deployment, figures possessing this Special Skill can place inside their ZC a Camo Marker which represents a camouflaged Mine, or a Marker representing the deployable weapon with which he is equipped (E/Mauler, Deployable Repeater). It may not be placed if any enemy troop is inside the area of effect of the deployable weapon. If the figure deploys using the Infiltration Special Skill and fails the PH roll, then a Mine Marker will be placed instead of a Camouflage marker. The Minelayer Special Skill is automatic and it does not require the spending of any Orders or the making of any rolls. The deployed weapon or equipment must be deducted from those carried by the figure.	 CH: Camouflage	The miniature has a special capacity, be it natural or learned, for hiding and stealth. He will also have chameleonic tools available: photoreactive cells and variable/ combinable environment patterns. These clothing-incorporated systems will merge the miniature with his surroundings.

The miniature is not deployed in the usual way: a Camouflage Marker is placed instead. This type of Deployment also allows 3 miniatures (All with the Special Skill of Camouflage) to be deployed under the same Marker. One or more miniatures can be separated from the group at any point in the game, moving as a separate Camouflage Marker. All the figures placed under the Camouflage Marker are revealed if the adversary makes a successful Discover Roll, or if some of the figures perform an Order that uncovers them.

In order to open/close a door, base to base contact is required.  Engineer also allows Mines to be deactivated (Antipersonnel and Monofilament), as well as E/Maulers and D-Charges. In order to deactivate a Mine in a same Order, the figure has to come into its action radius (Circular Template) and pass a WIP Roll. If successful, the Mine does not explode and is defused. If the WIP roll is failed, then it explodes, affecting the Engineer as normal.  	 V: Courage	Courage avoids, without spending any Order, the WIP Roll that is compulsory after surviving the impact of a ballistic weapon but the figure does not wish to move to cover (The Guts Roll made after a successful ARM Roll). The figure is not required to keep his position if he does not want to.  	Rifle	Pistol	Knife	D-Charges

In this state, the miniature is considered to be Prone and in base to base contact with Partial Cover in all directions, even though there may be no scenery item present, and it benefits from the CH: Mimetism and V: Courage Special Skills. Foxholes are fixed positions, to leave them, in an active or reactive turn, requires use of the Get Up Short Movement Skill. Moreover, by spending 1 Order, the figure can dig a new Foxhole, placing a Foxhole Marker beside it and using the above rules. When a miniature leaves a Foxhole, it loses the CH: Mimetism and V: Courage Special Skills, unless it has those Special Skills in addition to Sapper. A Foxhole Marker is removed from the game table when a figure exits it. The Foxhole Marker cannot be used by any figure other than the Sapper.	 Mechanized Deployment	The figure belongs to the Mechanized Infantry corps, whose armoured vehicles allow them to move ahead to cover the advance of their companions. During the deployment phase a miniature with Mechanized Deployment can be deployed in any part of the half of the game table corresponding to his side.

A Forward Observer in LoF with an enemy will be able to mark him after passing a WIP roll (Face to Face, or Normal, depending on the case), modified by Covers, Distance, Camouflage and Hiding Special Skill, or an Optical Disruptor Device. Distance Modifiers for marking with Forward Observer are applied as per the following table: There are two types of attacks that can be made as a result of the marking by a Forward Observer:   Speculative: When the Forward Observer passes his WIP Roll, the target remains marked for any other comrade that wants to shoot at that target, and the Speculative Fire Modifier is not applied.   Guided: When the Forward Observer passes his WIP Roll the target will remain marked for any other comrade possessing a weapon with Guided Ammunition. This figure will be able to use the Short Skill Ballistic Skills to hit the marked miniature without a roll required, as the WIP Roll of the Observer substitutes.   A miniature marked by a Forward Observer will be considered as marked until the end of the turn of the player possessing the Observer that marked it. The special equipment of Forward Observers allows them to use the Flash Pulse.

He will also have chameleonic tools available: photoreactive cells and variable/ combinable environment patterns. These clothing-incorporated systems will merge the miniature with his surroundings. The Special Skill of Camouflage allows its owner to perform:   Camouflaged Deployment: This use is exclusive to the deployment phase and does not require the spending of any Orders or making of rolls. The miniature is not deployed in the usual way: a Camouflage Marker is placed instead. This type of Deployment also allows 3 miniatures (All with the Special Skill of Camouflage) to be deployed under the same Marker. One or more miniatures can be separated from the group at any point in the game, moving as a separate Camouflage Marker. All the figures placed under the Camouflage Marker are revealed if the adversary makes a successful Discover Roll, or if some of the figures perform an Order that uncovers them. When revealed, figures must appear no more than inch of distance from each other, although the player can place them facing however he likes. In game terms, a Camouflage Marker is always the same height as a base troop figure from its own army (Unless it has a Prone Marker beside it).   Camouflage in Movement: This allows the player to move the miniature without placing him on the battlefield. Only his Camouflage Marker will move. When several miniatures are moved under the same Camouflage Marker, they behave as if they were only one miniature. If they have different MOV values, the lowest is always used. The only Skills whose execution does not automatically rreveal the camouflaged figures are Cautious Movement and all Short Skills of Movement that do not require any roll (except Alert). The camouflaged figure reveals automatically when it is in base contact with another figure. If the figure is Discovered or is automatically revealed, the Camouflage Marker is replaced by its miniature (or miniatures), facing how the player prefers. If a Camouflage Marker does not perform anything but MOV in his turn, even if it crosses a Suppression Fire zone or a figure's ZC, the only ARO that can be executed against it is Discover or Change Facing.   Defensive Camouflage: To act against a Camouflage Marker, enemies must succeed in a Discover roll with a -3 Modifier. If the roll is failed, the camouflaged figure is not perceived and may not be a target of BS, CC, or any other Skill (Hacking, Sepsitor, etc.). If the Camouflaged miniature (Or miniatures, if they are clustered) is discovered, it will have to be placed on the battlefield, substituting the Camouflage Maker and losing all the advantages of Camouflage in Movement and Combat, but still complicating any BS Roll against him with a Modifier of -3. When placing the figure over terrain, he can face any direction his owner chooses.   Combat Camouflage: This allows a miniature in a camouflaged state to make a BS, Forward Observer, Sepsitor or Hacking attack before his opponent does. This attack is made with a Normal Roll. If the adversary survives the attack, he may then make any attacks he may have declared in ARO which are also made as Normal Rolls, with -3 to BS if shooting at the revealed figure. After this, the player will have to replace the Camouflage Marker with the correct figure. Combat Camouflage is only available for use with Ballistic Skills. In ARO, the reactions of Camouflaged soldiers are simultaneous to the Order they react to, so Face to Face Rolls will be made. If the Camouflaged figure receives an Intuitive Attack without having been Discovered first, he will have to reveal himself even if he passes the ARM Roll, removing the Camouflage Marker and placing the real figure. In the same way, if he is affected by a Template but the target was another figure, he will have to make an ARM Roll, revealing himself whether he passes the roll or not.   Camouflaging Again: When a figure has lost the Camouflaged status (It is represented by its figure and not a Camouflage Marker), he can recover his former status by spending 1 Order, provided that he is not in the LoF of any enemy miniatures. A figure in TO Camouflage in LoF of a miniature that intends to Camouflage itself again will have to reveal himself if he desires to prevent his enemy from re-entering Camouflaged status.

The figure is not required to keep his position if he does not want to.  	 CH: Camouflage	The miniature has a special capacity, be it natural or learned, for hiding and stealth. He will also have chameleonic tools available: photoreactive cells and variable/ combinable environment patterns. These clothing-incorporated systems will merge the miniature with his surroundings. The Special Skill of Camouflage allows its owner to perform:   Camouflaged Deployment: This use is exclusive to the deployment phase and does not require the spending of any Orders or making of rolls. The miniature is not deployed in the usual way: a Camouflage Marker is placed instead. This type of Deployment also allows 3 miniatures (All with the Special Skill of Camouflage) to be deployed under the same Marker. One or more miniatures can be separated from the group at any point in the game, moving as a separate Camouflage Marker. All the figures placed under the Camouflage Marker are revealed if the adversary makes a successful Discover Roll, or if some of the figures perform an Order that uncovers them. When revealed, figures must appear no more than inch of distance from each other, although the player can place them facing however he likes. In game terms, a Camouflage Marker is always the same height as a base troop figure from its own army (Unless it has a Prone Marker beside it).   Camouflage in Movement: This allows the player to move the miniature without placing him on the battlefield. Only his Camouflage Marker will move. When several miniatures are moved under the same Camouflage Marker, they behave as if they were only one miniature. If they have different MOV values, the lowest is always used. The only Skills whose execution does not automatically rreveal the camouflaged figures are Cautious Movement and all Short Skills of Movement that do not require any roll (except Alert). The camouflaged figure reveals automatically when it is in base contact with another figure. If the figure is Discovered or is automatically revealed, the Camouflage Marker is replaced by its miniature (or miniatures), facing how the player prefers. If a Camouflage Marker does not perform anything but MOV in his turn, even if it crosses a Suppression Fire zone or a figure's ZC, the only ARO that can be executed against it is Discover or Change Facing.   Defensive Camouflage: To act against a Camouflage Marker, enemies must succeed in a Discover roll with a -3 Modifier. If the roll is failed, the camouflaged figure is not perceived and may not be a target of BS, CC, or any other Skill (Hacking, Sepsitor, etc.). If the Camouflaged miniature (Or miniatures, if they are clustered) is discovered, it will have to be placed on the battlefield, substituting the Camouflage Maker and losing all the advantages of Camouflage in Movement and Combat, but still complicating any BS Roll against him with a Modifier of -3. When placing the figure over terrain, he can face any direction his owner chooses.   Combat Camouflage: This allows a miniature in a camouflaged state to make a BS, Forward Observer, Sepsitor or Hacking attack before his opponent does. This attack is made with a Normal Roll. If the adversary survives the attack, he may then make any attacks he may have declared in ARO which are also made as Normal Rolls, with -3 to BS if shooting at the revealed figure. After this, the player will have to replace the Camouflage Marker with the correct figure. Combat Camouflage is only available for use with Ballistic Skills. In ARO, the reactions of Camouflaged soldiers are simultaneous to the Order they react to, so Face to Face Rolls will be made. If the Camouflaged figure receives an Intuitive Attack without having been Discovered first, he will have to reveal himself even if he passes the ARM Roll, removing the Camouflage Marker and placing the real figure. In the same way, if he is affected by a Template but the target was another figure, he will have to make an ARM Roll, revealing himself whether he passes the roll or not.   Camouflaging Again: When a figure has lost the Camouflaged status (It is represented by its figure and not a Camouflage Marker), he can recover his former status by spending 1 Order, provided that he is not in the LoF of any enemy miniatures. A figure in TO Camouflage in LoF of a miniature that intends to Camouflage itself again will have to reveal himself if he desires to prevent his enemy from re-entering Camouflaged status.

Infiltration	Due to his ability to move stealthily, the miniature will be able to infiltrate the enemy's lines without being noticed. The use of the Infiltrate Special Skill is only allowed in the Deployment Phase. Infiltration allows a miniature the following options:   Option A: The miniature can be deployed, without having to spend an Order or make a Roll, up to the central area of the game table (within the half corresponding to his army). He is deployed in Camouflage or TO Camouflage status if applicable.   Option B: If the miniature wants to go further into enemy territory, he must to pass a Normal Roll of PH. Each 4 inch strip of distance advanced into enemy territory will add a cumulative Modifier of -1 to the roll. If he fails the roll, the Dispersion rule must now be applied. The centre of the Circular Template must be placed at the point in the battlefield where the figure wished to Infiltrate, with the number 1 pointing to the centre of the game table, multiplying the Failure Category by 2.5 (FC x 2.5) to determine where to place the infiltrator. Moreover, the miniature will lose the Camouflaged Deployment and Hidden Deployment options provided by the CH: Camouflage and CH: TO Camouflage Special Skills.   It is not allowed to Infiltrate inside the enemy's Zone of Deployment, or in base contact with another figure. If Dispersion would place the miniature in either position, move the figure back towards its initial Infiltration point until it is no longer in an illegal position; ie. the figure will be placed on the limit of the enemy's Zone of Deployment closest to the initial Infiltration point.
