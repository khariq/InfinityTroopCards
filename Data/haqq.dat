Distance Modifiers for marking with Forward Observer are applied as per the following table: There are two types of attacks that can be made as a result of the marking by a Forward Observer:   Speculative: When the Forward Observer passes his WIP Roll, the target remains marked for any other comrade that wants to shoot at that target, and the Speculative Fire Modifier is not applied.   Guided: When the Forward Observer passes his WIP Roll the target will remain marked for any other comrade possessing a weapon with Guided Ammunition. This figure will be able to use the Short Skill Ballistic Skills to hit the marked miniature without a roll required, as the WIP Roll of the Observer substitutes.   A miniature marked by a Forward Observer will be considered as marked until the end of the turn of the player possessing the Observer that marked it.

Super-Jump	These miniatures are genetically, artificially, or evolutionarily designed to perform jumps of astonishing length and height. This Special Skill works automatically. It allows the miniature to move in a vertical, diagonal, or horizontal jump as many inches as indicated in his MOV, without having to make a PH Roll. Super-Jump is a Special Short Movement Skill that can be combined with other Short Skills. For example, with Super-Jump, the figure can shoot while flying through the air and this will be considered an Order of the Move+BS type. Also, when the miniature moves in a normal way he will be able to avoid any obstacle of his height or less without any Movement restriction. To calculate the Falling Damage taken by miniatures with SuperJump, the sum of both values of his MOV Attribute is subtracted from the distance and the result multiplied by 2.5. For example: a miniature with Super-Jump with MOV 4-4, that jumps from a terrace to the floor from a height of 10 inches will only have to make an ARM Roll against Damage 5 (distance of 10 minus MOV 4+4 = 2, multiplied by 2.5 to give 5).

The active player can deploy a miniature with AD: Combat Jump at any point during the battle. The figure spends 1 Order (His own, not one from the Orders Reserve) and makes a PH Normal Roll. If successful he deploys to any point on the table nominated by his owner, facing in any direction desired. Dispersion: If he fails the PH roll, the miniature suffers a detour in his fall, deviating as many inches as the Failure Category multiplied by 2.5 (FC x 2.5). In order to determine in which direction the miniature deviates, a Circular Template is used. Place the Circular Template on the target point where the miniature was supposed to land, with the number 1 facing towards the centre of the table. The second digit of the dice Roll is used indicate the direction in which the miniature deviate. If deviation prompts the figure to fall outside the battlefield, he will have to spend an extra Order from the Order Reserve to appear on the border of the game table at the point where he would have left. A figure cannot nominate as jump target the interior of a Smoke zone, or in Impassable Terrain or Zones of Low or Zero Visibility. The landing zone is of the same size as a Circular Template and must be free of scenery elements. The figure with Combat Jump can land on any point in the landing zone but the whole of its base must be in the interior of the Circular Template. A figure cannot land in base to base contact with another miniature. If a Coordinated Order is used to perform a Combat Jump, all the miniatures participating must choose the same template as their landing point. Those failing their PH Roll will be dispersed individually. Figures possessing Combat Jump can also deploy themselves, if they wish to, as if they possessed the preceding levels in AD.  Remotes with Combat Jump will have to perform a PH Roll in order to jump. PH determines the automation and programming level of their jumps.  Impetuous Figures with Combat Jump will have to use their Impetuous Order to perform their jump. If they do not want to jump immediately, at the beginning of the turn they must spend an Order from their army's Orders Reserve in order to stop each impetuous figure from deploying with their Impetuous Order.	 Religious Troop	The beliefs and teachings of his leaders have turned the miniature into an able warrior, with an unswerving faith that allows him to keep firm when others desist. This Special Skill functions automatically and allows the figure to keep his Order for himself after losing his Lieutenant, in addition to the minimum Orders due to Loss of Lieutenant. In addition the miniature may choose not be affected by the rules of Retreat! If all a player's figures are Religious, then two of them may give up their Orders to elect a new Lieutenant. Otherwise they may continue operating using only their own Orders.  	 V: Dogged	This Special Skill is automatic and does not require the use of Orders to be activated. Dogged allows the miniature to ignore the state of Unconscious. If the miniature uses the Dogged Skill he will be able to act normally provided he keeps spending Orders in a consecutive way.

See Hacker combat rules for details. All Hacking Devices are Repeaters for the other Hackers of the same army. . The Hacking Device Plus has an additional advanced system of Localization-Identification-Liaison that works as a Forward Observer, but only within the Hacker's, or his Repeater's, Zone of Control (8 inches): LoF with the enemy is not required. In order to mark a target with the Hacker Device Plus Forward Observer function, it is necessary to spend an Order and pass a WIP Roll. The target can react by Dodging the marking of the Forward Observer Hacking Device Plus, provided he has LoF.	 AD: Combat Jump	Figures with this special jump equipment are trained to descend at full speed over the battlefield surprising enemies with devastating sudden attacks. The active player can deploy a miniature with AD: Combat Jump at any point during the battle. The figure spends 1 Order (His own, not one from the Orders Reserve) and makes a PH Normal Roll. If successful he deploys to any point on the table nominated by his owner, facing in any direction desired. Dispersion: If he fails the PH roll, the miniature suffers a detour in his fall, deviating as many inches as the Failure Category multiplied by 2.5 (FC x 2.5). In order to determine in which direction the miniature deviates, a Circular Template is used. Place the Circular Template on the target point where the miniature was supposed to land, with the number 1 facing towards the centre of the table. The second digit of the dice Roll is used indicate the direction in which the miniature deviate. If deviation prompts the figure to fall outside the battlefield, he will have to spend an extra Order from the Order Reserve to appear on the border of the game table at the point where he would have left. A figure cannot nominate as jump target the interior of a Smoke zone, or in Impassable Terrain or Zones of Low or Zero Visibility. The landing zone is of the same size as a Circular Template and must be free of scenery elements. The figure with Combat Jump can land on any point in the landing zone but the whole of its base must be in the interior of the Circular Template. A figure cannot land in base to base contact with another miniature. If a Coordinated Order is used to perform a Combat Jump, all the miniatures participating must choose the same template as their landing point. Those failing their PH Roll will be dispersed individually. Figures possessing Combat Jump can also deploy themselves, if they wish to, as if they possessed the preceding levels in AD.  Remotes with Combat Jump will have to perform a PH Roll in order to jump. PH determines the automation and programming level of their jumps.  Impetuous Figures with Combat Jump will have to use their Impetuous Order to perform their jump. If they do not want to jump immediately, at the beginning of the turn they must spend an Order from their army's Orders Reserve in order to stop each impetuous figure from deploying with their Impetuous Order.	 Religious Troop	The beliefs and teachings of his leaders have turned the miniature into an able warrior, with an unswerving faith that allows him to keep firm when others desist. This Special Skill functions automatically and allows the figure to keep his Order for himself after losing his Lieutenant, in addition to the minimum Orders due to Loss of Lieutenant. In addition the miniature may choose not be affected by the rules of Retreat! If all a player's figures are Religious, then two of them may give up their Orders to elect a new Lieutenant. Otherwise they may continue operating using only their own Orders.  	 V: Dogged	This Special Skill is automatic and does not require the use of Orders to be activated. Dogged allows the miniature to ignore the state of Unconscious. If the miniature uses the Dogged Skill he will be able to act normally provided he keeps spending Orders in a consecutive way. The figure will die when the turn he would have fallen Unconscious finishes, if the player stops spending Orders on him in a consecutive way, or if he suffers another Wound. In addition, the Dogged Special Skill includes also the Courage Special Skill. Dogged cannot be used in ARO. Dogged allows Impetuous figures to spend Orders from the Orders Reserve in order to keep acting normally, even though the player hasn't finished spending Impetuous Orders.

He will also have chameleonic tools available: photoreactive cells and variable/ combinable environment patterns. These clothing-incorporated systems will merge the miniature with his surroundings. The Special Skill of Camouflage allows its owner to perform:   Camouflaged Deployment: This use is exclusive to the deployment phase and does not require the spending of any Orders or making of rolls. The miniature is not deployed in the usual way: a Camouflage Marker is placed instead. This type of Deployment also allows 3 miniatures (All with the Special Skill of Camouflage) to be deployed under the same Marker. One or more miniatures can be separated from the group at any point in the game, moving as a separate Camouflage Marker. All the figures placed under the Camouflage Marker are revealed if the adversary makes a successful Discover Roll, or if some of the figures perform an Order that uncovers them. When revealed, figures must appear no more than inch of distance from each other, although the player can place them facing however he likes. In game terms, a Camouflage Marker is always the same height as a base troop figure from its own army (Unless it has a Prone Marker beside it).   Camouflage in Movement: This allows the player to move the miniature without placing him on the battlefield. Only his Camouflage Marker will move. When several miniatures are moved under the same Camouflage Marker, they behave as if they were only one miniature. If they have different MOV values, the lowest is always used. The only Skills whose execution does not automatically rreveal the camouflaged figures are Cautious Movement and all Short Skills of Movement that do not require any roll (except Alert). The camouflaged figure reveals automatically when it is in base contact with another figure. If the figure is Discovered or is automatically revealed, the Camouflage Marker is replaced by its miniature (or miniatures), facing how the player prefers. If a Camouflage Marker does not perform anything but MOV in his turn, even if it crosses a Suppression Fire zone or a figure's ZC, the only ARO that can be executed against it is Discover or Change Facing.   Defensive Camouflage: To act against a Camouflage Marker, enemies must succeed in a Discover roll with a -3 Modifier. If the roll is failed, the camouflaged figure is not perceived and may not be a target of BS, CC, or any other Skill (Hacking, Sepsitor, etc.). If the Camouflaged miniature (Or miniatures, if they are clustered) is discovered, it will have to be placed on the battlefield, substituting the Camouflage Maker and losing all the advantages of Camouflage in Movement and Combat, but still complicating any BS Roll against him with a Modifier of -3. When placing the figure over terrain, he can face any direction his owner chooses.   Combat Camouflage: This allows a miniature in a camouflaged state to make a BS, Forward Observer, Sepsitor or Hacking attack before his opponent does. This attack is made with a Normal Roll. If the adversary survives the attack, he may then make any attacks he may have declared in ARO which are also made as Normal Rolls, with -3 to BS if shooting at the revealed figure. After this, the player will have to replace the Camouflage Marker with the correct figure. Combat Camouflage is only available for use with Ballistic Skills. In ARO, the reactions of Camouflaged soldiers are simultaneous to the Order they react to, so Face to Face Rolls will be made. If the Camouflaged figure receives an Intuitive Attack without having been Discovered first, he will have to reveal himself even if he passes the ARM Roll, removing the Camouflage Marker and placing the real figure. In the same way, if he is affected by a Template but the target was another figure, he will have to make an ARM Roll, revealing himself whether he passes the roll or not.   Camouflaging Again: When a figure has lost the Camouflaged status (It is represented by its figure and not a Camouflage Marker), he can recover his former status by spending 1 Order, provided that he is not in the LoF of any enemy miniatures. A figure in TO Camouflage in LoF of a miniature that intends to Camouflage itself again will have to reveal himself if he desires to prevent his enemy from re-entering Camouflaged status.	 Deployable Repeater	This portable and deployable instrument is used to amplify the range of hackers and is specially designed to be placed in a fixed point, covering a specific area. Placing and activating a Deployable Repeater is a Short Skill, and it must be marked by a Deployable Repeater Marker (REPEATER) placed in base contact with the user. Unlike Mines, it cannot be Camouflaged. Deployable Repeaters have ARM 0, BTS 0, STR 1 and an effective range radius of 8 inches. Each figure with Deployable Repeater carries a total of 3.  	 Infiltration	Due to his ability to move stealthily, the miniature will be able to infiltrate the enemy's lines without being noticed. The use of the Infiltrate Special Skill is only allowed in the Deployment Phase. Infiltration allows a miniature the following options:   Option A: The miniature can be deployed, without having to spend an Order or make a Roll, up to the central area of the game table (within the half corresponding to his army). He is deployed in Camouflage or TO Camouflage status if applicable.   Option B: If the miniature wants to go further into enemy territory, he must to pass a Normal Roll of PH. Each 4 inch strip of distance advanced into enemy territory will add a cumulative Modifier of -1 to the roll. If he fails the roll, the Dispersion rule must now be applied. The centre of the Circular Template must be placed at the point in the battlefield where the figure wished to Infiltrate, with the number 1 pointing to the centre of the game table, multiplying the Failure Category by 2.5 (FC x 2.5) to determine where to place the infiltrator. Moreover, the miniature will lose the Camouflaged Deployment and Hidden Deployment options provided by the CH: Camouflage and CH: TO Camouflage Special Skills.   It is not allowed to Infiltrate inside the enemy's Zone of Deployment, or in base contact with another figure. If Dispersion would place the miniature in either position, move the figure back towards its initial Infiltration point until it is no longer in an illegal position; ie. the figure will be placed on the limit of the enemy's Zone of Deployment closest to the initial Infiltration point.

He will also have chameleonic tools available: photoreactive cells and variable/ combinable environment patterns. These clothing-incorporated systems will merge the miniature with his surroundings. The Special Skill of Camouflage allows its owner to perform:   Camouflaged Deployment: This use is exclusive to the deployment phase and does not require the spending of any Orders or making of rolls. The miniature is not deployed in the usual way: a Camouflage Marker is placed instead. This type of Deployment also allows 3 miniatures (All with the Special Skill of Camouflage) to be deployed under the same Marker. One or more miniatures can be separated from the group at any point in the game, moving as a separate Camouflage Marker. All the figures placed under the Camouflage Marker are revealed if the adversary makes a successful Discover Roll, or if some of the figures perform an Order that uncovers them. When revealed, figures must appear no more than inch of distance from each other, although the player can place them facing however he likes. In game terms, a Camouflage Marker is always the same height as a base troop figure from its own army (Unless it has a Prone Marker beside it).   Camouflage in Movement: This allows the player to move the miniature without placing him on the battlefield. Only his Camouflage Marker will move. When several miniatures are moved under the same Camouflage Marker, they behave as if they were only one miniature. If they have different MOV values, the lowest is always used. The only Skills whose execution does not automatically rreveal the camouflaged figures are Cautious Movement and all Short Skills of Movement that do not require any roll (except Alert). The camouflaged figure reveals automatically when it is in base contact with another figure. If the figure is Discovered or is automatically revealed, the Camouflage Marker is replaced by its miniature (or miniatures), facing how the player prefers. If a Camouflage Marker does not perform anything but MOV in his turn, even if it crosses a Suppression Fire zone or a figure's ZC, the only ARO that can be executed against it is Discover or Change Facing.   Defensive Camouflage: To act against a Camouflage Marker, enemies must succeed in a Discover roll with a -3 Modifier. If the roll is failed, the camouflaged figure is not perceived and may not be a target of BS, CC, or any other Skill (Hacking, Sepsitor, etc.). If the Camouflaged miniature (Or miniatures, if they are clustered) is discovered, it will have to be placed on the battlefield, substituting the Camouflage Maker and losing all the advantages of Camouflage in Movement and Combat, but still complicating any BS Roll against him with a Modifier of -3.

A Forward Observer in LoF with an enemy will be able to mark him after passing a WIP roll (Face to Face, or Normal, depending on the case), modified by Covers, Distance, Camouflage and Hiding Special Skill, or an Optical Disruptor Device. Distance Modifiers for marking with Forward Observer are applied as per the following table: There are two types of attacks that can be made as a result of the marking by a Forward Observer:   Speculative: When the Forward Observer passes his WIP Roll, the target remains marked for any other comrade that wants to shoot at that target, and the Speculative Fire Modifier is not applied.   Guided: When the Forward Observer passes his WIP Roll the target will remain marked for any other comrade possessing a weapon with Guided Ammunition. This figure will be able to use the Short Skill Ballistic Skills to hit the marked miniature without a roll required, as the WIP Roll of the Observer substitutes.   A miniature marked by a Forward Observer will be considered as marked until the end of the turn of the player possessing the Observer that marked it. The special equipment of Forward Observers allows them to use the Flash Pulse.  	 CH: Camouflage	The miniature has a special capacity, be it natural or learned, for hiding and stealth.

Camouflaging again: Functions exactly as CH: L-2 Camouflage	 Infiltration	Due to his ability to move stealthily, the miniature will be able to infiltrate the enemy's lines without being noticed. The use of the Infiltrate Special Skill is only allowed in the Deployment Phase. Infiltration allows a miniature the following options:   Option A: The miniature can be deployed, without having to spend an Order or make a Roll, up to the central area of the game table (within the half corresponding to his army). He is deployed in Camouflage or TO Camouflage status if applicable.   Option B: If the miniature wants to go further into enemy territory, he must to pass a Normal Roll of PH. Each 4 inch strip of distance advanced into enemy territory will add a cumulative Modifier of -1 to the roll. If he fails the roll, the Dispersion rule must now be applied. The centre of the Circular Template must be placed at the point in the battlefield where the figure wished to Infiltrate, with the number 1 pointing to the centre of the game table, multiplying the Failure Category by 2.5 (FC x 2.5) to determine where to place the infiltrator. Moreover, the miniature will lose the Camouflaged Deployment and Hidden Deployment options provided by the CH: Camouflage and CH: TO Camouflage Special Skills.   It is not allowed to Infiltrate inside the enemy's Zone of Deployment, or in base contact with another figure. If Dispersion would place the miniature in either position, move the figure back towards its initial Infiltration point until it is no longer in an illegal position; ie. the figure will be placed on the limit of the enemy's Zone of Deployment closest to the initial Infiltration point.

Murabids Tuareg - Doctor	haqq.xcf	C:\Users\u0064666\Documents\GitHub\InfinityTroopCards\ImagesFromCB\Haqqis\280422-0126-Icon.png	C:\Users\u0064666\Documents\GitHub\InfinityTroopCards\ImagesFromCB\Haqqis\280422-0126.png	C:\Users\u0064666\Documents\GitHub\InfinityTroopCards\ImagesFromCB\Regular.png					4-4	13	11	12	15	1	0	1	2	0	34	Doctor, CH: TO Camouflage, Infiltration	Doctor	The miniature is a qualified doctor, with complete training in combat medicine and is a specialist in saving his companions from death. Doctor is a Short Skill that allows the miniature, when in base contact, after passing a WIP Roll, to make his patient pass from the Unconscious state to Normal, with a single Wound. If he fails the WIP Roll, the figure is considered to be Dead and is removed from the game table. Miniatures can be healed as many times as necessary, provided that the WIP rolls are successful. A miniature that has been healed can also benefit later from a MediKit, AutoMediKit, or Regeneration, and vice versa. A figure must be in base to base contact with a patient to use the Doctor Special Skill. A Doctor with the Special Skill V: No Wound Incapacitation who has suffered one Wound can try to heal himself but if he fails the WIP roll he will die automatically.  	 CH: TO Camouflage	The miniature possesses, besides the Special Skill Camouflage, a Thermo-Optical mimetizing device. This is a system that curves the light around its bearer, rendering him almost invisible and erasing his thermal signature. This sophisticated device also diffuses any possible atmospheric turbulence that its bearer may provoke and prevents his detection by radar or sonar. In game terms, TO Camouflage allows its possessor to perform the following:   Hidden Deployment: It allows the same type of deployment as CH: L-2 Camouflage, but there is no need to make use of a Marker. Provided that he does not move, the figure with CH: TO Camouflage will remain completely invisible. The player must take note of his figure's position in the most detailed possible way (Cover, Prone, etc.) so that the adversary will be able to verify the data in the moment in which he reveals his position. If the miniature moves, the player must place a TO Camouflage Marker, and show his adversary that he really was in that position from the beginning of the battle. If the figure performs any other action, he will have to be replaced by the miniature instead of the Marker. A miniature in Hidden Deployment does not add his Order to the Orders Reserve, as he is not on the game table. However, to carry out his first Order, which reveals his presence on the battlefield, he will not receive the Order from the Orders Reserve but will have to spend his own.   Camouflage in Movement: Allows the miniature to carry out the same Camouflaged Movement allowed by CH: Camouflage.   TO Defensive Camouflage: Allows the miniature the same Defensive Camouflage that CH: Camouflage provides, but a negative Modifier of -6 is applied if someone intends to attack him.   TO Combat Camouflage: Allows the same Combat Camouflage as CH: L-2 Camouflage, with no orders needing to be spent.

To represent the impersonator an Impersonation Marker State 1 (IMP-1) must be placed. The Marker can be deployed within the 12 inch strip of the enemy Deployment Zone after passing a WIP Roll. If he fails his WIP roll, the miniature deploys as a normal figure as if he had been discovered and recognized as an enemy. There are three states of Basic Impersonation.   State 1 - Unnoticed: The impersonator has infiltrated the enemy troops without being noticed, and will be considered a comrade by his enemies, who will not be able to act against him (Using BS; PH, CC, etc.). The impersonator figure is represented by an Impersonating Marker State 1 (IMP-1). In order to discover the impersonator, the enemy must make a Discover Roll with Modifier -6. If the roll is successful, the impersonator passes to state 2.   State 2 - Characterized: The impersonator has been detected, but he still tries to pass for a comrade. The state 1 Marker (IMP-1) is substituted by another of Impersonation state 2 (IMP-2), but the figure still cannot be attacked, as his identity is still not clear and he is still considered a comrade by his enemies. They must make another Discover roll, a Normal Roll without the -6 MOD, to identify him as an enemy. If this Discover roll is successful, the impersonation passes to state 3.  State 3 - Discovered: The IMP-2 marker is replaced on the table by the miniature. The impersonator has been identified as an enemy and can be attacked as usual.   The only Skills whose execution does not automatically reveal the impersonator are Cautious Movement and any Short Movement Skills that do not require any roll (except Alert). The Impersonator reveals automatically when he is in base contact with another figure. An impersonator not yet discovered can make a BS attack before his opponent can react. Therefore, no Face to Face Roll is made: each figure makes a Normal Roll of BS, the impersonator going first. If his adversary survives the ARM Roll, he may then return fire. After firing, the impersonator's miniature replaces any IMP Marker.  In ARO, impersonators' reactions are simultaneous with the Order being answered, so Face to Face Rolls are used.  To return to Impersonation status (Substituting the miniature with the IMP-1 Marker) 1 complete Order must be spent outside the LoF of any adversaries. An impersonator in state 1 or 2 (IMP-1 Marker or IMP-2) will be considered as a comrade by his adversary, but if he moves thrugh a Suppression Fire area he will be hit in a normal way. The miniature with Impersonation will always use his own Characteristics, Skills, and Equipment, although he will be able to pick up and use 1 enemy Weapon if he manages to kill a foe in Close Combat and then returns to Impersonation status. Scavenging a weapon from a victim is a Short Skill. Human figures with Basic Impersonation will never be able to pose as an alien miniature (Antipode, Morat, Shasvastii, etc.) and vice versa. The Impersonator will not be able to act in State 1 against the Combined Army of the E.I. but he will always act in State 2.  	 Martial Arts L3	First Attack: This allows the figure to attack first in CC, making a Normal Roll to hit. If the defender survives, he can counter attack with a Normal Roll of CC. A figure with this ability may also use the CC Attribute instead of PH to disengage from Close Combat. This level is only applicable in CC. Two figures with Martial Arts L3 will perform their First Attack at the same time, so they have to make a Face to Face Roll.  	 Religious Troop	The beliefs and teachings of his leaders have turned the miniature into an able warrior, with an unswerving faith that allows him to keep firm when others desist. This Special Skill functions automatically and allows the figure to keep his Order for himself after losing his Lieutenant, in addition to the minimum Orders due to Loss of Lieutenant. In addition the miniature may choose not be affected by the rules of Retreat! If all a player's figures are Religious, then two of them may give up their Orders to elect a new Lieutenant. Otherwise they may continue operating using only their own Orders.  	 						Rifle	Light Shotgun	Smoke Grenades	Pistol	EXP CCW

Engineer is a Short Skill that allows, with a successful Normal WIP Roll, the repair of Structure points (STR) of vehicles or figures (1 point per successful WIP Roll) which he is in base contact with. If the Engineer fails his WIP Roll, the target miniature or structure loses 1 point of STR instead of recovering it.  Engineers can reactivate all weapons, equipment and armour affected by E/M and Adhesive Special Ammunition if they they pass 1 single Normal WIP Roll when in contact with the affected figure. If the Engineer fails the WIP Roll when reactivating, it is considered that the weapon or equipment is permanently shut down with no possibility of recovery.  It is essential that a miniature be in base to base contact with the item he wants to repair.  Figures that posses this Short Skill can also open locks, applying the same Modifiers as Hacking Security and Information (See Advanced Rules: Hacking). In order to open/close a door, base to base contact is required.  Engineer also allows Mines to be deactivated (Antipersonnel and Monofilament), as well as E/Maulers and D-Charges. In order to deactivate a Mine in a same Order, the figure has to come into its action radius (Circular Template) and pass a WIP Roll. If successful, the Mine does not explode and is defused. If the WIP roll is failed, then it explodes, affecting the Engineer as normal.  	 										Light Shotgun	Rifle	D-Charges	Knife	Pistol

A Forward Observer in LoF with an enemy will be able to mark him after passing a WIP roll (Face to Face, or Normal, depending on the case), modified by Covers, Distance, Camouflage and Hiding Special Skill, or an Optical Disruptor Device. Distance Modifiers for marking with Forward Observer are applied as per the following table: There are two types of attacks that can be made as a result of the marking by a Forward Observer:   Speculative: When the Forward Observer passes his WIP Roll, the target remains marked for any other comrade that wants to shoot at that target, and the Speculative Fire Modifier is not applied.   Guided: When the Forward Observer passes his WIP Roll the target will remain marked for any other comrade possessing a weapon with Guided Ammunition. This figure will be able to use the Short Skill Ballistic Skills to hit the marked miniature without a roll required, as the WIP Roll of the Observer substitutes.   A miniature marked by a Forward Observer will be considered as marked until the end of the turn of the player possessing the Observer that marked it. The special equipment of Forward Observers allows them to use the Flash Pulse.  	 G: Remote Presence	Remote Presence: This Special Skill is possessed by Remotes and unmanned T.A.G.s. Remotes have pseudo-AIs and expert programs that rule their behaviour in combat, operating in pure logic where fear has no place. In the case of Remote Presence T.A.G.s, the driver is not physically present on the battlefield and remotely controls it from a safe distance. Remote Presence is considered confers the Valor: Courage Special Skill. Figures with Remote Presence cannot have a Cube.  	 Repeater	Hacking range amplification system. This allows Hackers to use their skill in a radius of 8 inches around the Repeater. The Hacker can be at any distance from the Repeater, and he does not need to keep a LoF with it. This is a Special Skill that functions automatically and does not need the spending of any Orders to work. The Repeater can only be used by Hackers of the same army, or an allied one.  	 Sensor	The miniature possesses high sensitivity detection equipment, or a perfect sense of smell, that allows him to detect hidden figures nearby. The miniature that possess Sensor can make a Normal WIP Roll (Distance, Camouflage or TO Camouflage Modifiers are not applied) to Discover all models that are Camouflaged or in Hidden Deployment within a radius of 8 inches around him. Sensor is a Short Skill and does not need a LoF. A miniature possessing the Sensor and Forward Observer Special Skills can mark a target outside his LoF (using his pertinent Short Skill), if he is within the Sensor radius of effect and the target has been previously discovered. In such a case, a Distance, Cover, CH and ODD Modifiers will not be applied to the Forward Observer WIP roll. A miniature with Camouflage, TO Camouflage, or Impersonation cannot Camouflage again, or return to the Impersonation state, within the Sensor area.

Total Reaction	Due to servos and a system of support and reinforcement of response speed and mobility, some miniatures are able to react with great celerity. To reflect this, Total Reaction allows the firing of the whole Burst (B) of a weapon in ARO. - If the BS roll is a Normal Roll, as many Rolls as the B value of the Weapon will be made. - If the BS roll is a Face to Face Roll, both players will have to make all their BS rolls.

In game terms, any miniature attacking a figure with Mimetism will have a -3 Modifier to his BS Attribute for ranged attacks.  	 Multiterrain	Troops with Multiterrain Skill prepare themselves extensively for every mission, training with simulators or in zones that approximate the location where they will carry out their operations. Those troops stationed in adverse environments that include several types of Special Terrain (Aquatic and Jungle, for instance) will also possess Multiterrain. Before starting the battle, figures with Multiterrain will be able to choose in which type of terrain they will be specialized (See Terrain section).

Poison	The miniature is able to secrete a neurotoxin which makes his blows highly lethal. Accordingly, the figure's CC weapon is counted as having Shock Special Ammunition. The effect of the Poison can be combined with any other Special Ammunition that his CC weapon possesses. In addition, each time a figure with the Poison Special Skill suffers a Wound in CC, his blood splatters automatically to cause a Damage 9 hit on his adversary. Blood splatters cause Normal (Never special) Damage, and as the direct result of a Short CC Skill, they cannot be dodged.

This Special Skill functions automatically and allows the figure to keep his Order for himself after losing his Lieutenant, in addition to the minimum Orders due to Loss of Lieutenant. In addition the miniature may choose not be affected by the rules of Retreat! If all a player's figures are Religious, then two of them may give up their Orders to elect a new Lieutenant. Otherwise they may continue operating using only their own Orders.  	 Super-Jump	These miniatures are genetically, artificially, or evolutionarily designed to perform jumps of astonishing length and height. This Special Skill works automatically. It allows the miniature to move in a vertical, diagonal, or horizontal jump as many inches as indicated in his MOV, without having to make a PH Roll. Super-Jump is a Special Short Movement Skill that can be combined with other Short Skills. For example, with Super-Jump, the figure can shoot while flying through the air and this will be considered an Order of the Move+BS type. Also, when the miniature moves in a normal way he will be able to avoid any obstacle of his height or less without any Movement restriction. To calculate the Falling Damage taken by miniatures with SuperJump, the sum of both values of his MOV Attribute is subtracted from the distance and the result multiplied by 2.5. For example: a miniature with Super-Jump with MOV 4-4, that jumps from a terrace to the floor from a height of 10 inches will only have to make an ARM Roll against Damage 5 (distance of 10 minus MOV 4+4 = 2, multiplied by 2.5 to give 5).

He will also have chameleonic tools available: photoreactive cells and variable/ combinable environment patterns. These clothing-incorporated systems will merge the miniature with his surroundings. The Special Skill of Camouflage allows its owner to perform:   Camouflaged Deployment: This use is exclusive to the deployment phase and does not require the spending of any Orders or making of rolls. The miniature is not deployed in the usual way: a Camouflage Marker is placed instead. This type of Deployment also allows 3 miniatures (All with the Special Skill of Camouflage) to be deployed under the same Marker. One or more miniatures can be separated from the group at any point in the game, moving as a separate Camouflage Marker. All the figures placed under the Camouflage Marker are revealed if the adversary makes a successful Discover Roll, or if some of the figures perform an Order that uncovers them. When revealed, figures must appear no more than inch of distance from each other, although the player can place them facing however he likes. In game terms, a Camouflage Marker is always the same height as a base troop figure from its own army (Unless it has a Prone Marker beside it).   Camouflage in Movement: This allows the player to move the miniature without placing him on the battlefield. Only his Camouflage Marker will move. When several miniatures are moved under the same Camouflage Marker, they behave as if they were only one miniature. If they have different MOV values, the lowest is always used. The only Skills whose execution does not automatically rreveal the camouflaged figures are Cautious Movement and all Short Skills of Movement that do not require any roll (except Alert). The camouflaged figure reveals automatically when it is in base contact with another figure. If the figure is Discovered or is automatically revealed, the Camouflage Marker is replaced by its miniature (or miniatures), facing how the player prefers. If a Camouflage Marker does not perform anything but MOV in his turn, even if it crosses a Suppression Fire zone or a figure's ZC, the only ARO that can be executed against it is Discover or Change Facing.   Defensive Camouflage: To act against a Camouflage Marker, enemies must succeed in a Discover roll with a -3 Modifier. If the roll is failed, the camouflaged figure is not perceived and may not be a target of BS, CC, or any other Skill (Hacking, Sepsitor, etc.). If the Camouflaged miniature (Or miniatures, if they are clustered) is discovered, it will have to be placed on the battlefield, substituting the Camouflage Maker and losing all the advantages of Camouflage in Movement and Combat, but still complicating any BS Roll against him with a Modifier of -3. When placing the figure over terrain, he can face any direction his owner chooses.   Combat Camouflage: This allows a miniature in a camouflaged state to make a BS, Forward Observer, Sepsitor or Hacking attack before his opponent does. This attack is made with a Normal Roll. If the adversary survives the attack, he may then make any attacks he may have declared in ARO which are also made as Normal Rolls, with -3 to BS if shooting at the revealed figure. After this, the player will have to replace the Camouflage Marker with the correct figure. Combat Camouflage is only available for use with Ballistic Skills. In ARO, the reactions of Camouflaged soldiers are simultaneous to the Order they react to, so Face to Face Rolls will be made. If the Camouflaged figure receives an Intuitive Attack without having been Discovered first, he will have to reveal himself even if he passes the ARM Roll, removing the Camouflage Marker and placing the real figure. In the same way, if he is affected by a Template but the target was another figure, he will have to make an ARM Roll, revealing himself whether he passes the roll or not.   Camouflaging Again: When a figure has lost the Camouflaged status (It is represented by its figure and not a Camouflage Marker), he can recover his former status by spending 1 Order, provided that he is not in the LoF of any enemy miniatures. A figure in TO Camouflage in LoF of a miniature that intends to Camouflage itself again will have to reveal himself if he desires to prevent his enemy from re-entering Camouflaged status.	 Infiltration	Due to his ability to move stealthily, the miniature will be able to infiltrate the enemy's lines without being noticed. The use of the Infiltrate Special Skill is only allowed in the Deployment Phase. Infiltration allows a miniature the following options:   Option A: The miniature can be deployed, without having to spend an Order or make a Roll, up to the central area of the game table (within the half corresponding to his army). He is deployed in Camouflage or TO Camouflage status if applicable.   Option B: If the miniature wants to go further into enemy territory, he must to pass a Normal Roll of PH. Each 4 inch strip of distance advanced into enemy territory will add a cumulative Modifier of -1 to the roll. If he fails the roll, the Dispersion rule must now be applied. The centre of the Circular Template must be placed at the point in the battlefield where the figure wished to Infiltrate, with the number 1 pointing to the centre of the game table, multiplying the Failure Category by 2.5 (FC x 2.5) to determine where to place the infiltrator. Moreover, the miniature will lose the Camouflaged Deployment and Hidden Deployment options provided by the CH: Camouflage and CH: TO Camouflage Special Skills.   It is not allowed to Infiltrate inside the enemy's Zone of Deployment, or in base contact with another figure. If Dispersion would place the miniature in either position, move the figure back towards its initial Infiltration point until it is no longer in an illegal position; ie. the figure will be placed on the limit of the enemy's Zone of Deployment closest to the initial Infiltration point.

A Forward Observer in LoF with an enemy will be able to mark him after passing a WIP roll (Face to Face, or Normal, depending on the case), modified by Covers, Distance, Camouflage and Hiding Special Skill, or an Optical Disruptor Device. Distance Modifiers for marking with Forward Observer are applied as per the following table: There are two types of attacks that can be made as a result of the marking by a Forward Observer:   Speculative: When the Forward Observer passes his WIP Roll, the target remains marked for any other comrade that wants to shoot at that target, and the Speculative Fire Modifier is not applied.   Guided: When the Forward Observer passes his WIP Roll the target will remain marked for any other comrade possessing a weapon with Guided Ammunition. This figure will be able to use the Short Skill Ballistic Skills to hit the marked miniature without a roll required, as the WIP Roll of the Observer substitutes.   A miniature marked by a Forward Observer will be considered as marked until the end of the turn of the player possessing the Observer that marked it. The special equipment of Forward Observers allows them to use the Flash Pulse.  	 CH: Camouflage	The miniature has a special capacity, be it natural or learned, for hiding and stealth.

Regeneration	The miniature's system is specially suited for self-healing and physical and metabolic regeneration. Regeneration is a Short Skill that allows the miniature, after passing a Normal PH Roll, to regenerate 1 Wound and even recover from an Unconscious state. When the miniature loses all his Wounds and becomes Unconscious, he must place a Wound Marker next to his figure. If he fails his PH Roll while Unconscious, he passes to the status of Dead and is removed from the game table. If the number of Wounds received leaves the miniature in a Dead state before being able to activate Regeneration, he will not be able to use this Special Skill again, and will have to be removed from the table. (For example, if a miniature with 1 Wound receives 3 hits from a Burst and fails 2 Armour Rolls). While the figure is in Unconscious state he will not add his Order to his army Orders Reserve. Figures with Regeneration automatically possess the Shock Immunity Special Skill. Regeneration is compatible with the use of MediKit or Doctor.

A Forward Observer in LoF with an enemy will be able to mark him after passing a WIP roll (Face to Face, or Normal, depending on the case), modified by Covers, Distance, Camouflage and Hiding Special Skill, or an Optical Disruptor Device. Distance Modifiers for marking with Forward Observer are applied as per the following table: There are two types of attacks that can be made as a result of the marking by a Forward Observer:   Speculative: When the Forward Observer passes his WIP Roll, the target remains marked for any other comrade that wants to shoot at that target, and the Speculative Fire Modifier is not applied.   Guided: When the Forward Observer passes his WIP Roll the target will remain marked for any other comrade possessing a weapon with Guided Ammunition. This figure will be able to use the Short Skill Ballistic Skills to hit the marked miniature without a roll required, as the WIP Roll of the Observer substitutes.   A miniature marked by a Forward Observer will be considered as marked until the end of the turn of the player possessing the Observer that marked it.

In game terms, if the trooper is on the game table as a figure or a Marker, and the Lieutenant falls Unconscious or Dead, he will take command automatically, becoming the new Lieutenant with no spending of Orders required and ignoring the effects of the Loss of Lieutenant rule. If, when the Lieutenant is shot down, the owner of the Chain of Command Special Skill is off the game table, once he is placed on it the Loss of Lieutenant state is cancelled and the player automatically recovers the entire Order Reserve that would have been available, with the exception of Orders spent previously. This Special Skill functions automatically and its use is not optional.  	 CH: Camouflage	The miniature has a special capacity, be it natural or learned, for hiding and stealth. He will also have chameleonic tools available: photoreactive cells and variable/ combinable environment patterns. These clothing-incorporated systems will merge the miniature with his surroundings. The Special Skill of Camouflage allows its owner to perform:   Camouflaged Deployment: This use is exclusive to the deployment phase and does not require the spending of any Orders or making of rolls. The miniature is not deployed in the usual way: a Camouflage Marker is placed instead. This type of Deployment also allows 3 miniatures (All with the Special Skill of Camouflage) to be deployed under the same Marker. One or more miniatures can be separated from the group at any point in the game, moving as a separate Camouflage Marker. All the figures placed under the Camouflage Marker are revealed if the adversary makes a successful Discover Roll, or if some of the figures perform an Order that uncovers them. When revealed, figures must appear no more than inch of distance from each other, although the player can place them facing however he likes. In game terms, a Camouflage Marker is always the same height as a base troop figure from its own army (Unless it has a Prone Marker beside it).   Camouflage in Movement: This allows the player to move the miniature without placing him on the battlefield. Only his Camouflage Marker will move. When several miniatures are moved under the same Camouflage Marker, they behave as if they were only one miniature. If they have different MOV values, the lowest is always used. The only Skills whose execution does not automatically rreveal the camouflaged figures are Cautious Movement and all Short Skills of Movement that do not require any roll (except Alert). The camouflaged figure reveals automatically when it is in base contact with another figure. If the figure is Discovered or is automatically revealed, the Camouflage Marker is replaced by its miniature (or miniatures), facing how the player prefers. If a Camouflage Marker does not perform anything but MOV in his turn, even if it crosses a Suppression Fire zone or a figure's ZC, the only ARO that can be executed against it is Discover or Change Facing.   Defensive Camouflage: To act against a Camouflage Marker, enemies must succeed in a Discover roll with a -3 Modifier. If the roll is failed, the camouflaged figure is not perceived and may not be a target of BS, CC, or any other Skill (Hacking, Sepsitor, etc.). If the Camouflaged miniature (Or miniatures, if they are clustered) is discovered, it will have to be placed on the battlefield, substituting the Camouflage Maker and losing all the advantages of Camouflage in Movement and Combat, but still complicating any BS Roll against him with a Modifier of -3. When placing the figure over terrain, he can face any direction his owner chooses.   Combat Camouflage: This allows a miniature in a camouflaged state to make a BS, Forward Observer, Sepsitor or Hacking attack before his opponent does. This attack is made with a Normal Roll. If the adversary survives the attack, he may then make any attacks he may have declared in ARO which are also made as Normal Rolls, with -3 to BS if shooting at the revealed figure. After this, the player will have to replace the Camouflage Marker with the correct figure. Combat Camouflage is only available for use with Ballistic Skills. In ARO, the reactions of Camouflaged soldiers are simultaneous to the Order they react to, so Face to Face Rolls will be made. If the Camouflaged figure receives an Intuitive Attack without having been Discovered first, he will have to reveal himself even if he passes the ARM Roll, removing the Camouflage Marker and placing the real figure. In the same way, if he is affected by a Template but the target was another figure, he will have to make an ARM Roll, revealing himself whether he passes the roll or not.   Camouflaging Again: When a figure has lost the Camouflaged status (It is represented by its figure and not a Camouflage Marker), he can recover his former status by spending 1 Order, provided that he is not in the LoF of any enemy miniatures. A figure in TO Camouflage in LoF of a miniature that intends to Camouflage itself again will have to reveal himself if he desires to prevent his enemy from re-entering Camouflaged status.	 Infiltration	Due to his ability to move stealthily, the miniature will be able to infiltrate the enemy's lines without being noticed. The use of the Infiltrate Special Skill is only allowed in the Deployment Phase. Infiltration allows a miniature the following options:   Option A: The miniature can be deployed, without having to spend an Order or make a Roll, up to the central area of the game table (within the half corresponding to his army). He is deployed in Camouflage or TO Camouflage status if applicable.   Option B: If the miniature wants to go further into enemy territory, he must to pass a Normal Roll of PH. Each 4 inch strip of distance advanced into enemy territory will add a cumulative Modifier of -1 to the roll. If he fails the roll, the Dispersion rule must now be applied. The centre of the Circular Template must be placed at the point in the battlefield where the figure wished to Infiltrate, with the number 1 pointing to the centre of the game table, multiplying the Failure Category by 2.5 (FC x 2.5) to determine where to place the infiltrator. Moreover, the miniature will lose the Camouflaged Deployment and Hidden Deployment options provided by the CH: Camouflage and CH: TO Camouflage Special Skills.   It is not allowed to Infiltrate inside the enemy's Zone of Deployment, or in base contact with another figure. If Dispersion would place the miniature in either position, move the figure back towards its initial Infiltration point until it is no longer in an illegal position; ie. the figure will be placed on the limit of the enemy's Zone of Deployment closest to the initial Infiltration point.  	 Religious Troop	The beliefs and teachings of his leaders have turned the miniature into an able warrior, with an unswerving faith that allows him to keep firm when others desist. This Special Skill functions automatically and allows the figure to keep his Order for himself after losing his Lieutenant, in addition to the minimum Orders due to Loss of Lieutenant. In addition the miniature may choose not be affected by the rules of Retreat! If all a player's figures are Religious, then two of them may give up their Orders to elect a new Lieutenant. Otherwise they may continue operating using only their own Orders.  	 				Boarding Shotgun	Contender	Knife	Pistol

To represent the impersonator an Impersonation Marker State 1 (IMP-1) must be placed. The Marker can be deployed within the 12 inch strip of the enemy Deployment Zone after passing a WIP Roll. If he fails his WIP roll, the miniature deploys as a normal figure as if he had been discovered and recognized as an enemy. There are three states of Basic Impersonation.   State 1 - Unnoticed: The impersonator has infiltrated the enemy troops without being noticed, and will be considered a comrade by his enemies, who will not be able to act against him (Using BS; PH, CC, etc.). The impersonator figure is represented by an Impersonating Marker State 1 (IMP-1). In order to discover the impersonator, the enemy must make a Discover Roll with Modifier -6. If the roll is successful, the impersonator passes to state 2.   State 2 - Characterized: The impersonator has been detected, but he still tries to pass for a comrade. The state 1 Marker (IMP-1) is substituted by another of Impersonation state 2 (IMP-2), but the figure still cannot be attacked, as his identity is still not clear and he is still considered a comrade by his enemies. They must make another Discover roll, a Normal Roll without the -6 MOD, to identify him as an enemy. If this Discover roll is successful, the impersonation passes to state 3.  State 3 - Discovered: The IMP-2 marker is replaced on the table by the miniature. The impersonator has been identified as an enemy and can be attacked as usual.   The only Skills whose execution does not automatically reveal the impersonator are Cautious Movement and any Short Movement Skills that do not require any roll (except Alert). The Impersonator reveals automatically when he is in base contact with another figure. An impersonator not yet discovered can make a BS attack before his opponent can react. Therefore, no Face to Face Roll is made: each figure makes a Normal Roll of BS, the impersonator going first. If his adversary survives the ARM Roll, he may then return fire. After firing, the impersonator's miniature replaces any IMP Marker.  In ARO, impersonators' reactions are simultaneous with the Order being answered, so Face to Face Rolls are used.  To return to Impersonation status (Substituting the miniature with the IMP-1 Marker) 1 complete Order must be spent outside the LoF of any adversaries. An impersonator in state 1 or 2 (IMP-1 Marker or IMP-2) will be considered as a comrade by his adversary, but if he moves thrugh a Suppression Fire area he will be hit in a normal way. The miniature with Impersonation will always use his own Characteristics, Skills, and Equipment, although he will be able to pick up and use 1 enemy Weapon if he manages to kill a foe in Close Combat and then returns to Impersonation status. Scavenging a weapon from a victim is a Short Skill. Human figures with Basic Impersonation will never be able to pose as an alien miniature (Antipode, Morat, Shasvastii, etc.) and vice versa. The Impersonator will not be able to act in State 1 against the Combined Army of the E.I. but he will always act in State 2.  	 Martial Arts L4	Empty Mind: This functions as Sixth Sense L1, cancelling out Martial Arts Skills of Levels 1-3 of opponents. It also makes opponents incapable of turning to face this figure as an ARO when he enters their ZC from behind, unless they have Sixth Sense L2.  	 Religious Troop	The beliefs and teachings of his leaders have turned the miniature into an able warrior, with an unswerving faith that allows him to keep firm when others desist. This Special Skill functions automatically and allows the figure to keep his Order for himself after losing his Lieutenant, in addition to the minimum Orders due to Loss of Lieutenant. In addition the miniature may choose not be affected by the rules of Retreat! If all a player's figures are Religious, then two of them may give up their Orders to elect a new Lieutenant. Otherwise they may continue operating using only their own Orders.  	 Personality		 				Light Shotgun	Rifle	Smoke Grenades	Pistol	Viral CCW

This programme has no effect on T.A.G.s of the Combined Army.   Support Hacking: Up to three Hackers can spend an Order each to give support to a companion. Each Hacker supporting provides a +3 Modifier to the Hacking Roll of the supported figure.Trajectory Assistant: By spending 1 Order the Hacker provides a +3 Modifier to the PH Roll of a figure who is going to perform a Combat Jump. In the case of a Coordinated Combat Jump of various troops dropping all inside the same Circular Template, then it is only necessary for the Hacker to spend a single Order to provide assistance to all of them.   The Hacker must announce, immediately after declaring his Hacking Order, which of the four EVO Support Programmes he is going to use. The EVO Support Programmes are not combinable, not even in Coordinated Order. These Support Programmes cannot be used in ARO.   Hacking Guided Ammunition: In a reactive turn, thanks to the EVO Repeater, a successful Hacking Guided Ammunition action will not only cause a guided munition to miss, but will also jam a Forward Observer's mark on its target. This only disables a Forward Observer's mark as it applies to Guided Ammunition, not for its use in other attacks such as Speculative Fire. This effect lasts until the end of the turn. If a Hacker with an EVO Repeater deployed on the battlefield hacks 1 Guided projectile fired against a figure marked by a Forward Observer, for the rest of the turn he will cause any Guided projectile shot at that miniature to miss automatically. Any further Guided projectile fired against such a figure during that turn will be deflected by the Hacker as an automatic ARO, without any roll necessary. Following a successful Hacking Guided Ammunition roll, a target may be marked again by the same, or another, Forward Observer to allow further Guided projectiles to be fired at it. A new Hacking Guided Ammunition roll is required each and every time the target miniature is marked by another Forward Observer, or again by the same Forward Observer, in order to make Guided Ammunition fired at the target miss.	 Baggage		 G: Remote Presence	Remote Presence: This Special Skill is possessed by Remotes and unmanned T.A.G.s. Remotes have pseudo-AIs and expert programs that rule their behaviour in combat, operating in pure logic where fear has no place. In the case of Remote Presence T.A.G.s, the driver is not physically present on the battlefield and remotely controls it from a safe distance. Remote Presence is considered confers the Valor: Courage Special Skill. Figures with Remote Presence cannot have a Cube.  	 Repeater	Hacking range amplification system. This allows Hackers to use their skill in a radius of 8 inches around the Repeater. The Hacker can be at any distance from the Repeater, and he does not need to keep a LoF with it. This is a Special Skill that functions automatically and does not need the spending of any Orders to work. The Repeater can only be used by Hackers of the same army, or an allied one.

Nasmat Remotes	haqq.xcf			C:\Users\u0064666\Documents\GitHub\InfinityTroopCards\ImagesFromCB\Regular.png		C:\Users\u0064666\Documents\GitHub\InfinityTroopCards\ImagesFromCB\Sectorials\Hassassin_Bahram_logo.png	2	No	6-4	8	8	8	13	0	-3	1	2	0	3	CH: Mimetism, G: Servant	CH: Mimetism	The figure has the special ability to obscure his appearance to an enemy. Moreover, he has basic mimetic tools and clothes or camouflage gear made with a photosensitive material, a cheaper alternative to chameleonic tools, and knows how to use it with the maximum results in order to avoid discovery. In game terms, any miniature attacking a figure with Mimetism will have a -3 Modifier to his BS Attribute for ranged attacks.  	 G: Servant	With Ghost: Servant, the figure and the Remote are activated at the same time with only 1 Order. It works similarly to Ghost: Synchronized, as both must declare the same Order. If one of the two figures cannot perform the complete Order (the Long Skill or both Short Skills of the Order), he will be inactive and he will not perform the Order. However, if he can only perform one of the two Short Skills of the Order, then he will perform that single Skill, while the other figure will perform the complete Order. The difference from Ghost: Synchronized is that the Doctor/ Engineer makes the WIP roll, and it is the Remote who performs it. The Doctor/ Engineer can heal, repair or act through the Ghost: Servant, but it is necessary that the Remote be in base contact with the target. The Remote has not the Doctor neither the Engineer Special Skills: it cannot heal or repair by itself as it need to be controlled by the Doctor/ Engineer. Usually, to allow the Servant Remote moves until reach its target, the Doctor/ Engineer declares the Order but doesn't perform it, being in a safe place on the battlefield. Meanwhile, it is the Servant Remote who performs the Order, moving until in base contact with the target. The Doctor/ Engineer and the Remote only provide a single Order to the Orders Reserve and both are activated with only one Order. It is mandatory both figures belong to the same Combat Group where they count as a single figure. A Doctor/ Engineer can have more than 1 Servant Remote, but he can only activate them one by one, applying the other rules considerations. Meanwhile, the other Remotes will be inactive. As they are activated by one single Order, the Doctor/ Engineer and the Remote will provide a single ARO to each figure with LoF to either or both of them. If they cross a Suppression Fire (SF) zone, both can receive shots from the shooter maintaining the SF. The Doctor/ Engineer and the Remote each get their own ARO in reaction to every Order declared in their LoF or inside their Zone of Control. These AROs must be the same for both figures, applying the Ghost: Synchronized rule.  The Doctor/ Engineer can see through the sensors and optical devices of his Remote, so he can react to any Order declared in LoF or ZC of his Remote with Alert, Change Facing, Dodging or with any Skill which does not require LoF to perform. The Servant Remote always disconnects automatically if the Doctor/ Engineer is out of the game table (Due to Airborne Deployment, Hidden Deployment, ...) or if he falls Unconscious or Dead. A disconnected Remote stands still and cannot receive Orders or perform AROs. An Immobilized (IMM) Marker must be placed beside the base of a disconnected Remote. The Remote connects automatically, without spending any Order or Short Skill, at the end of an Order in which the Doctor/ Engineer comes back from Unconscious state or enters the game table. Contrary to Ghost: Synchronized, there is no limit in the operating distance between the Servant Remote and its Doctor/ Engineer. Servant Remotes are Not Impetuous figures, so they cannot be activated with Impetuous Orders.  Remotes with Ghost: Servant which possess the Airborne Deployment (AD) Special Skill can be deployed by spending 1 Order from the Order Reserve or, if the player prefers, by using the same Order through which its Doctor/ Engineer is deployed, without requiring the spending of an additional Order. In such a situation, they must be deployed at the same time and from the same side of the game table, or using the same Circular Template, as their Doctor/ Engineer. Remotes with Ghost: Servant also have the G: Remote Presence Special Skill. Remotes with Ghost: Servant don't provide Victory Points to the enemy and are not counted as casualties for the Retreat! rule. If the Doctor/ Engineer is hacked (If he is liable to be hacked) or if he receives a hit from E/M Special Ammunition and fails his BTS roll, his Remote will disconnect automatically because its link is interrupted. The Remote will connect again at the end of the Order in which the Doctor/ Engineer is freed from the hacking or his equipment is repaired. A sepsitorized Doctor/ Engineer can use his Ghost: Servant in the normal way.	 								Electric Pulse

Doctor is a Short Skill that allows the miniature, when in base contact, after passing a WIP Roll, to make his patient pass from the Unconscious state to Normal, with a single Wound. If he fails the WIP Roll, the figure is considered to be Dead and is removed from the game table. Miniatures can be healed as many times as necessary, provided that the WIP rolls are successful. A miniature that has been healed can also benefit later from a MediKit, AutoMediKit, or Regeneration, and vice versa. A figure must be in base to base contact with a patient to use the Doctor Special Skill. A Doctor with the Special Skill V: No Wound Incapacitation who has suffered one Wound can try to heal himself but if he fails the WIP roll he will die automatically.  	 CH: Mimetism	The figure has the special ability to obscure his appearance to an enemy. Moreover, he has basic mimetic tools and clothes or camouflage gear made with a photosensitive material, a cheaper alternative to chameleonic tools, and knows how to use it with the maximum results in order to avoid discovery. In game terms, any miniature attacking a figure with Mimetism will have a -3 Modifier to his BS Attribute for ranged attacks.
