This element does not count as a Support Weapon when performing the Support Weapons calculation in army construction. The Booty does not substitute for the figure's basic equipment: it is instead a complement. Before starting the battle a roll is made on the table to ascertain which extra element of equipment the figure has. If, in the course of a battle, a unit with the Special Skill Booty finds the dying body of another figure (in Unconscious state), he can spend 1 Order to scavenge. He may gain the figure's ARM value instead of his own, or take one of its weapons or pieces of equipment. He will be able to pick only one object and in return must throw away any piece of Booty he is currently carrying.  	 AD: Combat Jump	Figures with this special jump equipment are trained to descend at full speed over the battlefield surprising enemies with devastating sudden attacks. The active player can deploy a miniature with AD: Combat Jump at any point during the battle. The figure spends 1 Order (His own, not one from the Orders Reserve) and makes a PH Normal Roll. If successful he deploys to any point on the table nominated by his owner, facing in any direction desired. Dispersion: If he fails the PH roll, the miniature suffers a detour in his fall, deviating as many inches as the Failure Category multiplied by 2.5 (FC x 2.5). In order to determine in which direction the miniature deviates, a Circular Template is used. Place the Circular Template on the target point where the miniature was supposed to land, with the number 1 facing towards the centre of the table. The second digit of the dice Roll is used indicate the direction in which the miniature deviate. If deviation prompts the figure to fall outside the battlefield, he will have to spend an extra Order from the Order Reserve to appear on the border of the game table at the point where he would have left. A figure cannot nominate as jump target the interior of a Smoke zone, or in Impassable Terrain or Zones of Low or Zero Visibility. The landing zone is of the same size as a Circular Template and must be free of scenery elements. The figure with Combat Jump can land on any point in the landing zone but the whole of its base must be in the interior of the Circular Template. A figure cannot land in base to base contact with another miniature. If a Coordinated Order is used to perform a Combat Jump, all the miniatures participating must choose the same template as their landing point. Those failing their PH Roll will be dispersed individually. Figures possessing Combat Jump can also deploy themselves, if they wish to, as if they possessed the preceding levels in AD.  Remotes with Combat Jump will have to perform a PH Roll in order to jump. PH determines the automation and programming level of their jumps.  Impetuous Figures with Combat Jump will have to use their Impetuous Order to perform their jump. If they do not want to jump immediately, at the beginning of the turn they must spend an Order from their army's Orders Reserve in order to stop each impetuous figure from deploying with their Impetuous Order.

If the defender survives, he can counter attack with a Normal Roll of CC. A figure with this ability may also use the CC Attribute instead of PH to disengage from Close Combat. This level is only applicable in CC. Two figures with Martial Arts L3 will perform their First Attack at the same time, so they have to make a Face to Face Roll.  	 Total Immunity	Total Immunity: The miniature is immune to all the special Weapons and Ammunition (Except Adhesive, E/M, Monofilament and Plasma), which are considered as normal attacks.  	 Super-Jump	These miniatures are genetically, artificially, or evolutionarily designed to perform jumps of astonishing length and height. This Special Skill works automatically. It allows the miniature to move in a vertical, diagonal, or horizontal jump as many inches as indicated in his MOV, without having to make a PH Roll. Super-Jump is a Special Short Movement Skill that can be combined with other Short Skills. For example, with Super-Jump, the figure can shoot while flying through the air and this will be considered an Order of the Move+BS type. Also, when the miniature moves in a normal way he will be able to avoid any obstacle of his height or less without any Movement restriction. To calculate the Falling Damage taken by miniatures with SuperJump, the sum of both values of his MOV Attribute is subtracted from the distance and the result multiplied by 2.5. For example: a miniature with Super-Jump with MOV 4-4, that jumps from a terrace to the floor from a height of 10 inches will only have to make an ARM Roll against Damage 5 (distance of 10 minus MOV 4+4 = 2, multiplied by 2.5 to give 5).

In this way, when attacked from within an 8 inch radius in his Zone of Control, the miniature will answer the assault in a simultaneous fashion with a Face to Face Roll. Figures with Sixth Sense L1 will be able to react against Impersonators, Camouflaged, TO Camouflaged figures and enemies hidden by a Zero Visibility Zone inside their Zone of Control only at the moment of being attacked, acting as if those miniatures were in front of them and revealed but not Camouflaged and not applying the Modifier of -6 for a Zero Visibility Zone. They cannot however react to movements or any other action of Impersonators, Camouflaged and TO Camouflaged foes or troops hidden by a Zero Visibility Zone.

In this way, when attacked from within an 8 inch radius in his Zone of Control, the miniature will answer the assault in a simultaneous fashion with a Face to Face Roll. Figures with Sixth Sense L1 will be able to react against Impersonators, Camouflaged, TO Camouflaged figures and enemies hidden by a Zero Visibility Zone inside their Zone of Control only at the moment of being attacked, acting as if those miniatures were in front of them and revealed but not Camouflaged and not applying the Modifier of -6 for a Zero Visibility Zone.

It also makes opponents incapable of turning to face this figure as an ARO when he enters their ZC from behind, unless they have Sixth Sense L2.  	 CH: TO Camouflage	The miniature possesses, besides the Special Skill Camouflage, a Thermo-Optical mimetizing device. This is a system that curves the light around its bearer, rendering him almost invisible and erasing his thermal signature. This sophisticated device also diffuses any possible atmospheric turbulence that its bearer may provoke and prevents his detection by radar or sonar. In game terms, TO Camouflage allows its possessor to perform the following:   Hidden Deployment: It allows the same type of deployment as CH: L-2 Camouflage, but there is no need to make use of a Marker. Provided that he does not move, the figure with CH: TO Camouflage will remain completely invisible. The player must take note of his figure's position in the most detailed possible way (Cover, Prone, etc.) so that the adversary will be able to verify the data in the moment in which he reveals his position. If the miniature moves, the player must place a TO Camouflage Marker, and show his adversary that he really was in that position from the beginning of the battle. If the figure performs any other action, he will have to be replaced by the miniature instead of the Marker. A miniature in Hidden Deployment does not add his Order to the Orders Reserve, as he is not on the game table. However, to carry out his first Order, which reveals his presence on the battlefield, he will not receive the Order from the Orders Reserve but will have to spend his own.   Camouflage in Movement: Allows the miniature to carry out the same Camouflaged Movement allowed by CH: Camouflage.   TO Defensive Camouflage: Allows the miniature the same Defensive Camouflage that CH: Camouflage provides, but a negative Modifier of -6 is applied if someone intends to attack him.   TO Combat Camouflage: Allows the same Combat Camouflage as CH: L-2 Camouflage, with no orders needing to be spent.   Camouflaging again: Functions exactly as CH: L-2 Camouflage	 Infiltration	Due to his ability to move stealthily, the miniature will be able to infiltrate the enemy's lines without being noticed. The use of the Infiltrate Special Skill is only allowed in the Deployment Phase. Infiltration allows a miniature the following options:   Option A: The miniature can be deployed, without having to spend an Order or make a Roll, up to the central area of the game table (within the half corresponding to his army). He is deployed in Camouflage or TO Camouflage status if applicable.   Option B: If the miniature wants to go further into enemy territory, he must to pass a Normal Roll of PH. Each 4 inch strip of distance advanced into enemy territory will add a cumulative Modifier of -1 to the roll. If he fails the roll, the Dispersion rule must now be applied. The centre of the Circular Template must be placed at the point in the battlefield where the figure wished to Infiltrate, with the number 1 pointing to the centre of the game table, multiplying the Failure Category by 2.5 (FC x 2.5) to determine where to place the infiltrator. Moreover, the miniature will lose the Camouflaged Deployment and Hidden Deployment options provided by the CH: Camouflage and CH: TO Camouflage Special Skills.   It is not allowed to Infiltrate inside the enemy's Zone of Deployment, or in base contact with another figure. If Dispersion would place the miniature in either position, move the figure back towards its initial Infiltration point until it is no longer in an illegal position; ie. the figure will be placed on the limit of the enemy's Zone of Deployment closest to the initial Infiltration point.

This is an automatic Special Skill and it does not require the spending of any Orders or the making of any rolls to use it.	 Regeneration	The miniature's system is specially suited for self-healing and physical and metabolic regeneration. Regeneration is a Short Skill that allows the miniature, after passing a Normal PH Roll, to regenerate 1 Wound and even recover from an Unconscious state.

Engineer	Any figure with this Special Skill has the means and technical knowledge required to carry out campaign repairs on faulty or damaged equipment. Engineer is a Short Skill that allows, with a successful Normal WIP Roll, the repair of Structure points (STR) of vehicles or figures (1 point per successful WIP Roll) which he is in base contact with. If the Engineer fails his WIP Roll, the target miniature or structure loses 1 point of STR instead of recovering it.  Engineers can reactivate all weapons, equipment and armour affected by E/M and Adhesive Special Ammunition if they they pass 1 single Normal WIP Roll when in contact with the affected figure. If the Engineer fails the WIP Roll when reactivating, it is considered that the weapon or equipment is permanently shut down with no possibility of recovery.  It is essential that a miniature be in base to base contact with the item he wants to repair.  Figures that posses this Short Skill can also open locks, applying the same Modifiers as Hacking Security and Information (See Advanced Rules: Hacking). In order to open/close a door, base to base contact is required.  Engineer also allows Mines to be deactivated (Antipersonnel and Monofilament), as well as E/Maulers and D-Charges. In order to deactivate a Mine in a same Order, the figure has to come into its action radius (Circular Template) and pass a WIP Roll. If successful, the Mine does not explode and is defused. If the WIP roll is failed, then it explodes, affecting the Engineer as normal.  	 V: Courage	Courage avoids, without spending any Order, the WIP Roll that is compulsory after surviving the impact of a ballistic weapon but the figure does not wish to move to cover (The Guts Roll made after a successful ARM Roll). The figure is not required to keep his position if he does not want to.  	 Companion: Scarface		 				Combi Rifle	Chain Colt	D-Charges	Pistol	Knife

In this way, when attacked from within an 8 inch radius in his Zone of Control, the miniature will answer the assault in a simultaneous fashion with a Face to Face Roll. Figures with Sixth Sense L1 will be able to react against Impersonators, Camouflaged, TO Camouflaged figures and enemies hidden by a Zero Visibility Zone inside their Zone of Control only at the moment of being attacked, acting as if those miniatures were in front of them and revealed but not Camouflaged and not applying the Modifier of -6 for a Zero Visibility Zone. They cannot however react to movements or any other action of Impersonators, Camouflaged and TO Camouflaged foes or troops hidden by a Zero Visibility Zone.
