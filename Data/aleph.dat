MediKit	This is a wound recovery medical device carried by all Paramedics. It is used to heal Unconscious miniatures. Using the MediKit is a Short Skill that requires a PH Roll with a -3 Modifier by the patient. If he fails his roll, he will immediately pass to the Dead state and will be removed from the game table. If he passes the roll, the patient recovers 1 Wound, automatically leaving the Unconscious state and contributing his Order again to the Orders Reserve of his army in the next active turn. With a MediKit, miniatures can be healed from the Unconscious state as many times as necessary, provided they pass their PH-3 Rolls. Human MediKits do not work on Aliens (Assault Packs, Dog-Warriors, etc.) and vice versa. The MediKit is the most frequent medical system of nano-injection on battlefields. There are several syringe models; the most modern being a device with the form of a gun, using a chamber with a magnetic coil. After introducing the nanotreatment cartridge and pulling the electric trigger, the magnetic field accelerator injects at high speed the medical nanobots suspended in the cartridge serum. Other versions of the MediKit are the hypo-spray, with a lower speed performance, or the archaic pneumatic pistols.  	Combi Rifle	Electric Pulse

The Climbing Plus Special Skill allows the figure to perform other skills while climbing or hanging from a great height (Climbing+BS per example).  	 Forward Observer	Forward Observer is a Short Skill. A Forward Observer in LoF with an enemy will be able to mark him after passing a WIP roll (Face to Face, or Normal, depending on the case), modified by Covers, Distance, Camouflage and Hiding Special Skill, or an Optical Disruptor Device. Distance Modifiers for marking with Forward Observer are applied as per the following table: There are two types of attacks that can be made as a result of the marking by a Forward Observer:   Speculative: When the Forward Observer passes his WIP Roll, the target remains marked for any other comrade that wants to shoot at that target, and the Speculative Fire Modifier is not applied.   Guided: When the Forward Observer passes his WIP Roll the target will remain marked for any other comrade possessing a weapon with Guided Ammunition. This figure will be able to use the Short Skill Ballistic Skills to hit the marked miniature without a roll required, as the WIP Roll of the Observer substitutes.   A miniature marked by a Forward Observer will be considered as marked until the end of the turn of the player possessing the Observer that marked it.

This is a system that curves the light around its bearer, rendering him almost invisible and erasing his thermal signature. This sophisticated device also diffuses any possible atmospheric turbulence that its bearer may provoke and prevents his detection by radar or sonar. In game terms, TO Camouflage allows its possessor to perform the following:   Hidden Deployment: It allows the same type of deployment as CH: L-2 Camouflage, but there is no need to make use of a Marker. Provided that he does not move, the figure with CH: TO Camouflage will remain completely invisible. The player must take note of his figure's position in the most detailed possible way (Cover, Prone, etc.) so that the adversary will be able to verify the data in the moment in which he reveals his position. If the miniature moves, the player must place a TO Camouflage Marker, and show his adversary that he really was in that position from the beginning of the battle. If the figure performs any other action, he will have to be replaced by the miniature instead of the Marker. A miniature in Hidden Deployment does not add his Order to the Orders Reserve, as he is not on the game table. However, to carry out his first Order, which reveals his presence on the battlefield, he will not receive the Order from the Orders Reserve but will have to spend his own.   Camouflage in Movement: Allows the miniature to carry out the same Camouflaged Movement allowed by CH: Camouflage.   TO Defensive Camouflage: Allows the miniature the same Defensive Camouflage that CH: Camouflage provides, but a negative Modifier of -6 is applied if someone intends to attack him.   TO Combat Camouflage: Allows the same Combat Camouflage as CH: L-2 Camouflage, with no orders needing to be spent.   Camouflaging again: Functions exactly as CH: L-2 Camouflage	 Infiltration	Due to his ability to move stealthily, the miniature will be able to infiltrate the enemy's lines without being noticed. The use of the Infiltrate Special Skill is only allowed in the Deployment Phase. Infiltration allows a miniature the following options:   Option A: The miniature can be deployed, without having to spend an Order or make a Roll, up to the central area of the game table (within the half corresponding to his army). He is deployed in Camouflage or TO Camouflage status if applicable.   Option B: If the miniature wants to go further into enemy territory, he must to pass a Normal Roll of PH. Each 4 inch strip of distance advanced into enemy territory will add a cumulative Modifier of -1 to the roll. If he fails the roll, the Dispersion rule must now be applied. The centre of the Circular Template must be placed at the point in the battlefield where the figure wished to Infiltrate, with the number 1 pointing to the centre of the game table, multiplying the Failure Category by 2.5 (FC x 2.5) to determine where to place the infiltrator. Moreover, the miniature will lose the Camouflaged Deployment and Hidden Deployment options provided by the CH: Camouflage and CH: TO Camouflage Special Skills.   It is not allowed to Infiltrate inside the enemy's Zone of Deployment, or in base contact with another figure. If Dispersion would place the miniature in either position, move the figure back towards its initial Infiltration point until it is no longer in an illegal position; ie. the figure will be placed on the limit of the enemy's Zone of Deployment closest to the initial Infiltration point.

A Forward Observer in LoF with an enemy will be able to mark him after passing a WIP roll (Face to Face, or Normal, depending on the case), modified by Covers, Distance, Camouflage and Hiding Special Skill, or an Optical Disruptor Device. Distance Modifiers for marking with Forward Observer are applied as per the following table: There are two types of attacks that can be made as a result of the marking by a Forward Observer:   Speculative: When the Forward Observer passes his WIP Roll, the target remains marked for any other comrade that wants to shoot at that target, and the Speculative Fire Modifier is not applied.   Guided: When the Forward Observer passes his WIP Roll the target will remain marked for any other comrade possessing a weapon with Guided Ammunition. This figure will be able to use the Short Skill Ballistic Skills to hit the marked miniature without a roll required, as the WIP Roll of the Observer substitutes.   A miniature marked by a Forward Observer will be considered as marked until the end of the turn of the player possessing the Observer that marked it. The special equipment of Forward Observers allows them to use the Flash Pulse.  	 CH: TO Camouflage	The miniature possesses, besides the Special Skill Camouflage, a Thermo-Optical mimetizing device. This is a system that curves the light around its bearer, rendering him almost invisible and erasing his thermal signature. This sophisticated device also diffuses any possible atmospheric turbulence that its bearer may provoke and prevents his detection by radar or sonar. In game terms, TO Camouflage allows its possessor to perform the following:   Hidden Deployment: It allows the same type of deployment as CH: L-2 Camouflage, but there is no need to make use of a Marker. Provided that he does not move, the figure with CH: TO Camouflage will remain completely invisible. The player must take note of his figure's position in the most detailed possible way (Cover, Prone, etc.) so that the adversary will be able to verify the data in the moment in which he reveals his position. If the miniature moves, the player must place a TO Camouflage Marker, and show his adversary that he really was in that position from the beginning of the battle. If the figure performs any other action, he will have to be replaced by the miniature instead of the Marker. A miniature in Hidden Deployment does not add his Order to the Orders Reserve, as he is not on the game table. However, to carry out his first Order, which reveals his presence on the battlefield, he will not receive the Order from the Orders Reserve but will have to spend his own.   Camouflage in Movement: Allows the miniature to carry out the same Camouflaged Movement allowed by CH: Camouflage.   TO Defensive Camouflage: Allows the miniature the same Defensive Camouflage that CH: Camouflage provides, but a negative Modifier of -6 is applied if someone intends to attack him.   TO Combat Camouflage: Allows the same Combat Camouflage as CH: L-2 Camouflage, with no orders needing to be spent.

Remotes with Combat Jump will have to perform a PH Roll in order to jump. PH determines the automation and programming level of their jumps.  Impetuous Figures with Combat Jump will have to use their Impetuous Order to perform their jump. If they do not want to jump immediately, at the beginning of the turn they must spend an Order from their army's Orders Reserve in order to stop each impetuous figure from deploying with their Impetuous Order.

Moreover, he has basic mimetic tools and clothes or camouflage gear made with a photosensitive material, a cheaper alternative to chameleonic tools, and knows how to use it with the maximum results in order to avoid discovery.

He will also have chameleonic tools available: photoreactive cells and variable/ combinable environment patterns. These clothing-incorporated systems will merge the miniature with his surroundings. The Special Skill of Camouflage allows its owner to perform:   Camouflaged Deployment: This use is exclusive to the deployment phase and does not require the spending of any Orders or making of rolls. The miniature is not deployed in the usual way: a Camouflage Marker is placed instead. This type of Deployment also allows 3 miniatures (All with the Special Skill of Camouflage) to be deployed under the same Marker. One or more miniatures can be separated from the group at any point in the game, moving as a separate Camouflage Marker. All the figures placed under the Camouflage Marker are revealed if the adversary makes a successful Discover Roll, or if some of the figures perform an Order that uncovers them. When revealed, figures must appear no more than inch of distance from each other, although the player can place them facing however he likes. In game terms, a Camouflage Marker is always the same height as a base troop figure from its own army (Unless it has a Prone Marker beside it).   Camouflage in Movement: This allows the player to move the miniature without placing him on the battlefield. Only his Camouflage Marker will move. When several miniatures are moved under the same Camouflage Marker, they behave as if they were only one miniature. If they have different MOV values, the lowest is always used. The only Skills whose execution does not automatically rreveal the camouflaged figures are Cautious Movement and all Short Skills of Movement that do not require any roll (except Alert). The camouflaged figure reveals automatically when it is in base contact with another figure. If the figure is Discovered or is automatically revealed, the Camouflage Marker is replaced by its miniature (or miniatures), facing how the player prefers. If a Camouflage Marker does not perform anything but MOV in his turn, even if it crosses a Suppression Fire zone or a figure's ZC, the only ARO that can be executed against it is Discover or Change Facing.   Defensive Camouflage: To act against a Camouflage Marker, enemies must succeed in a Discover roll with a -3 Modifier. If the roll is failed, the camouflaged figure is not perceived and may not be a target of BS, CC, or any other Skill (Hacking, Sepsitor, etc.). If the Camouflaged miniature (Or miniatures, if they are clustered) is discovered, it will have to be placed on the battlefield, substituting the Camouflage Maker and losing all the advantages of Camouflage in Movement and Combat, but still complicating any BS Roll against him with a Modifier of -3. When placing the figure over terrain, he can face any direction his owner chooses.   Combat Camouflage: This allows a miniature in a camouflaged state to make a BS, Forward Observer, Sepsitor or Hacking attack before his opponent does. This attack is made with a Normal Roll. If the adversary survives the attack, he may then make any attacks he may have declared in ARO which are also made as Normal Rolls, with -3 to BS if shooting at the revealed figure. After this, the player will have to replace the Camouflage Marker with the correct figure. Combat Camouflage is only available for use with Ballistic Skills. In ARO, the reactions of Camouflaged soldiers are simultaneous to the Order they react to, so Face to Face Rolls will be made. If the Camouflaged figure receives an Intuitive Attack without having been Discovered first, he will have to reveal himself even if he passes the ARM Roll, removing the Camouflage Marker and placing the real figure. In the same way, if he is affected by a Template but the target was another figure, he will have to make an ARM Roll, revealing himself whether he passes the roll or not.   Camouflaging Again: When a figure has lost the Camouflaged status (It is represented by its figure and not a Camouflage Marker), he can recover his former status by spending 1 Order, provided that he is not in the LoF of any enemy miniatures. A figure in TO Camouflage in LoF of a miniature that intends to Camouflage itself again will have to reveal himself if he desires to prevent his enemy from re-entering Camouflaged status.	 Infiltration	Due to his ability to move stealthily, the miniature will be able to infiltrate the enemy's lines without being noticed. The use of the Infiltrate Special Skill is only allowed in the Deployment Phase. Infiltration allows a miniature the following options:   Option A: The miniature can be deployed, without having to spend an Order or make a Roll, up to the central area of the game table (within the half corresponding to his army). He is deployed in Camouflage or TO Camouflage status if applicable.   Option B: If the miniature wants to go further into enemy territory, he must to pass a Normal Roll of PH. Each 4 inch strip of distance advanced into enemy territory will add a cumulative Modifier of -1 to the roll. If he fails the roll, the Dispersion rule must now be applied. The centre of the Circular Template must be placed at the point in the battlefield where the figure wished to Infiltrate, with the number 1 pointing to the centre of the game table, multiplying the Failure Category by 2.5 (FC x 2.5) to determine where to place the infiltrator. Moreover, the miniature will lose the Camouflaged Deployment and Hidden Deployment options provided by the CH: Camouflage and CH: TO Camouflage Special Skills.   It is not allowed to Infiltrate inside the enemy's Zone of Deployment, or in base contact with another figure. If Dispersion would place the miniature in either position, move the figure back towards its initial Infiltration point until it is no longer in an illegal position; ie. the figure will be placed on the limit of the enemy's Zone of Deployment closest to the initial Infiltration point.

Combat Camouflage: This allows a miniature in a camouflaged state to make a BS, Forward Observer, Sepsitor or Hacking attack before his opponent does. This attack is made with a Normal Roll. If the adversary survives the attack, he may then make any attacks he may have declared in ARO which are also made as Normal Rolls, with -3 to BS if shooting at the revealed figure. After this, the player will have to replace the Camouflage Marker with the correct figure. Combat Camouflage is only available for use with Ballistic Skills. In ARO, the reactions of Camouflaged soldiers are simultaneous to the Order they react to, so Face to Face Rolls will be made. If the Camouflaged figure receives an Intuitive Attack without having been Discovered first, he will have to reveal himself even if he passes the ARM Roll, removing the Camouflage Marker and placing the real figure. In the same way, if he is affected by a Template but the target was another figure, he will have to make an ARM Roll, revealing himself whether he passes the roll or not.   Camouflaging Again: When a figure has lost the Camouflaged status (It is represented by its figure and not a Camouflage Marker), he can recover his former status by spending 1 Order, provided that he is not in the LoF of any enemy miniatures. A figure in TO Camouflage in LoF of a miniature that intends to Camouflage itself again will have to reveal himself if he desires to prevent his enemy from re-entering Camouflaged status.

During Deployment, figures possessing this Special Skill can place inside their ZC a Camo Marker which represents a camouflaged Mine, or a Marker representing the deployable weapon with which he is equipped (E/Mauler, Deployable Repeater). It may not be placed if any enemy troop is inside the area of effect of the deployable weapon. If the figure deploys using the Infiltration Special Skill and fails the PH roll, then a Mine Marker will be placed instead of a Camouflage marker. The Minelayer Special Skill is automatic and it does not require the spending of any Orders or the making of any rolls. The deployed weapon or equipment must be deducted from those carried by the figure.	 CH: Camouflage	The miniature has a special capacity, be it natural or learned, for hiding and stealth. He will also have chameleonic tools available: photoreactive cells and variable/ combinable environment patterns. These clothing-incorporated systems will merge the miniature with his surroundings. The Special Skill of Camouflage allows its owner to perform:   Camouflaged Deployment: This use is exclusive to the deployment phase and does not require the spending of any Orders or making of rolls. The miniature is not deployed in the usual way: a Camouflage Marker is placed instead. This type of Deployment also allows 3 miniatures (All with the Special Skill of Camouflage) to be deployed under the same Marker. One or more miniatures can be separated from the group at any point in the game, moving as a separate Camouflage Marker. All the figures placed under the Camouflage Marker are revealed if the adversary makes a successful Discover Roll, or if some of the figures perform an Order that uncovers them. When revealed, figures must appear no more than inch of distance from each other, although the player can place them facing however he likes. In game terms, a Camouflage Marker is always the same height as a base troop figure from its own army (Unless it has a Prone Marker beside it).   Camouflage in Movement: This allows the player to move the miniature without placing him on the battlefield. Only his Camouflage Marker will move. When several miniatures are moved under the same Camouflage Marker, they behave as if they were only one miniature. If they have different MOV values, the lowest is always used. The only Skills whose execution does not automatically rreveal the camouflaged figures are Cautious Movement and all Short Skills of Movement that do not require any roll (except Alert). The camouflaged figure reveals automatically when it is in base contact with another figure. If the figure is Discovered or is automatically revealed, the Camouflage Marker is replaced by its miniature (or miniatures), facing how the player prefers. If a Camouflage Marker does not perform anything but MOV in his turn, even if it crosses a Suppression Fire zone or a figure's ZC, the only ARO that can be executed against it is Discover or Change Facing.   Defensive Camouflage: To act against a Camouflage Marker, enemies must succeed in a Discover roll with a -3 Modifier. If the roll is failed, the camouflaged figure is not perceived and may not be a target of BS, CC, or any other Skill (Hacking, Sepsitor, etc.).

He is deployed in Camouflage or TO Camouflage status if applicable.   Option B: If the miniature wants to go further into enemy territory, he must to pass a Normal Roll of PH. Each 4 inch strip of distance advanced into enemy territory will add a cumulative Modifier of -1 to the roll. If he fails the roll, the Dispersion rule must now be applied. The centre of the Circular Template must be placed at the point in the battlefield where the figure wished to Infiltrate, with the number 1 pointing to the centre of the game table, multiplying the Failure Category by 2.5 (FC x 2.5) to determine where to place the infiltrator. Moreover, the miniature will lose the Camouflaged Deployment and Hidden Deployment options provided by the CH: Camouflage and CH: TO Camouflage Special Skills.   It is not allowed to Infiltrate inside the enemy's Zone of Deployment, or in base contact with another figure. If Dispersion would place the miniature in either position, move the figure back towards its initial Infiltration point until it is no longer in an illegal position; ie. the figure will be placed on the limit of the enemy's Zone of Deployment closest to the initial Infiltration point.

The active player can deploy a miniature with AD: Combat Jump at any point during the battle. The figure spends 1 Order (His own, not one from the Orders Reserve) and makes a PH Normal Roll. If successful he deploys to any point on the table nominated by his owner, facing in any direction desired. Dispersion: If he fails the PH roll, the miniature suffers a detour in his fall, deviating as many inches as the Failure Category multiplied by 2.5 (FC x 2.5). In order to determine in which direction the miniature deviates, a Circular Template is used. Place the Circular Template on the target point where the miniature was supposed to land, with the number 1 facing towards the centre of the table. The second digit of the dice Roll is used indicate the direction in which the miniature deviate. If deviation prompts the figure to fall outside the battlefield, he will have to spend an extra Order from the Order Reserve to appear on the border of the game table at the point where he would have left. A figure cannot nominate as jump target the interior of a Smoke zone, or in Impassable Terrain or Zones of Low or Zero Visibility. The landing zone is of the same size as a Circular Template and must be free of scenery elements. The figure with Combat Jump can land on any point in the landing zone but the whole of its base must be in the interior of the Circular Template. A figure cannot land in base to base contact with another miniature. If a Coordinated Order is used to perform a Combat Jump, all the miniatures participating must choose the same template as their landing point. Those failing their PH Roll will be dispersed individually. Figures possessing Combat Jump can also deploy themselves, if they wish to, as if they possessed the preceding levels in AD.  Remotes with Combat Jump will have to perform a PH Roll in order to jump. PH determines the automation and programming level of their jumps.  Impetuous Figures with Combat Jump will have to use their Impetuous Order to perform their jump. If they do not want to jump immediately, at the beginning of the turn they must spend an Order from their army's Orders Reserve in order to stop each impetuous figure from deploying with their Impetuous Order.	 AI Beacon	AI Beacon: Data net signal emitter which allow Artificial Intelligences to enhance the range and effectiveness of their particular data sphere. In game terms, the function of an AI Beacon is to provide 1 Order to the Order Reserve of its army. An AI Beacon must always be deployed with AD: Combat Jump, but its deployment is performed during the Deployment Phase. If its Dispersion means it falls off the game table, it must be considered lost and cannot be recovered during the battle. An AI Beacon must be assigned to a Combat Group, which cannot surpass the maximum of ten Orders. This piece of Equipment is vulnerable to E/M Special Ammunition and cannot be picked up with the Booty Special Skill.	Electric Pulse

The presence of an EVO Repeater increases the lethal capacity of Hackers, providing a greater power over enemy equipment and systems. In game terms, having an EVO Repeater deployed on the game table allows the Hackers of its army, without spending any additional Orders, to choose between the following different Support Programmes for use when hacking:   Icebreaker: When making a hacking roll, the EVO halves the Biotechnological Shield (BTS) of the target, always rounding up.   Capture: Thanks to the EVO, the Hacker only needs 1 successful WIP Roll to completely possess a T.A.G. and control it in Possessed status (Marker POS). This programme has no effect on T.A.G.s of the Combined Army.   Support Hacking: Up to three Hackers can spend an Order each to give support to a companion. Each Hacker supporting provides a +3 Modifier to the Hacking Roll of the supported figure.Trajectory Assistant: By spending 1 Order the Hacker provides a +3 Modifier to the PH Roll of a figure who is going to perform a Combat Jump. In the case of a Coordinated Combat Jump of various troops dropping all inside the same Circular Template, then it is only necessary for the Hacker to spend a single Order to provide assistance to all of them.   The Hacker must announce, immediately after declaring his Hacking Order, which of the four EVO Support Programmes he is going to use. The EVO Support Programmes are not combinable, not even in Coordinated Order. These Support Programmes cannot be used in ARO.   Hacking Guided Ammunition: In a reactive turn, thanks to the EVO Repeater, a successful Hacking Guided Ammunition action will not only cause a guided munition to miss, but will also jam a Forward Observer's mark on its target. This only disables a Forward Observer's mark as it applies to Guided Ammunition, not for its use in other attacks such as Speculative Fire. This effect lasts until the end of the turn. If a Hacker with an EVO Repeater deployed on the battlefield hacks 1 Guided projectile fired against a figure marked by a Forward Observer, for the rest of the turn he will cause any Guided projectile shot at that miniature to miss automatically. Any further Guided projectile fired against such a figure during that turn will be deflected by the Hacker as an automatic ARO, without any roll necessary. Following a successful Hacking Guided Ammunition roll, a target may be marked again by the same, or another, Forward Observer to allow further Guided projectiles to be fired at it. A new Hacking Guided Ammunition roll is required each and every time the target miniature is marked by another Forward Observer, or again by the same Forward Observer, in order to make Guided Ammunition fired at the target miss.

Doctor is a Short Skill that allows the miniature, when in base contact, after passing a WIP Roll, to make his patient pass from the Unconscious state to Normal, with a single Wound. If he fails the WIP Roll, the figure is considered to be Dead and is removed from the game table. Miniatures can be healed as many times as necessary, provided that the WIP rolls are successful. A miniature that has been healed can also benefit later from a MediKit, AutoMediKit, or Regeneration, and vice versa. A figure must be in base to base contact with a patient to use the Doctor Special Skill. A Doctor with the Special Skill V: No Wound Incapacitation who has suffered one Wound can try to heal himself but if he fails the WIP roll he will die automatically.  	 Engineer	Any figure with this Special Skill has the means and technical knowledge required to carry out campaign repairs on faulty or damaged equipment. Engineer is a Short Skill that allows, with a successful Normal WIP Roll, the repair of Structure points (STR) of vehicles or figures (1 point per successful WIP Roll) which he is in base contact with. If the Engineer fails his WIP Roll, the target miniature or structure loses 1 point of STR instead of recovering it.  Engineers can reactivate all weapons, equipment and armour affected by E/M and Adhesive Special Ammunition if they they pass 1 single Normal WIP Roll when in contact with the affected figure. If the Engineer fails the WIP Roll when reactivating, it is considered that the weapon or equipment is permanently shut down with no possibility of recovery.  It is essential that a miniature be in base to base contact with the item he wants to repair.  Figures that posses this Short Skill can also open locks, applying the same Modifiers as Hacking Security and Information (See Advanced Rules: Hacking). In order to open/close a door, base to base contact is required.  Engineer also allows Mines to be deactivated (Antipersonnel and Monofilament), as well as E/Maulers and D-Charges. In order to deactivate a Mine in a same Order, the figure has to come into its action radius (Circular Template) and pass a WIP Roll. If successful, the Mine does not explode and is defused. If the WIP roll is failed, then it explodes, affecting the Engineer as normal.  	Combi Rifle	D-Charges	Knife	Pistol		
Yudbots			C:\Users\u0064666\Pictures\Cards\ImagesFromCB\Regular.png		6-4	8	8	8	13	0	-3	1	2	0	3	CH: Mimetism, G: Servant	CH: Mimetism	The figure has the special ability to obscure his appearance to an enemy. Moreover, he has basic mimetic tools and clothes or camouflage gear made with a photosensitive material, a cheaper alternative to chameleonic tools, and knows how to use it with the maximum results in order to avoid discovery. In game terms, any miniature attacking a figure with Mimetism will have a -3 Modifier to his BS Attribute for ranged attacks.  	 G: Servant	With Ghost: Servant, the figure and the Remote are activated at the same time with only 1 Order. It works similarly to Ghost: Synchronized, as both must declare the same Order. If one of the two figures cannot perform the complete Order (the Long Skill or both Short Skills of the Order), he will be inactive and he will not perform the Order. However, if he can only perform one of the two Short Skills of the Order, then he will perform that single Skill, while the other figure will perform the complete Order. The difference from Ghost: Synchronized is that the Doctor/ Engineer makes the WIP roll, and it is the Remote who performs it. The Doctor/ Engineer can heal, repair or act through the Ghost: Servant, but it is necessary that the Remote be in base contact with the target. The Remote has not the Doctor neither the Engineer Special Skills: it cannot heal or repair by itself as it need to be controlled by the Doctor/ Engineer. Usually, to allow the Servant Remote moves until reach its target, the Doctor/ Engineer declares the Order but doesn't perform it, being in a safe place on the battlefield. Meanwhile, it is the Servant Remote who performs the Order, moving until in base contact with the target. The Doctor/ Engineer and the Remote only provide a single Order to the Orders Reserve and both are activated with only one Order. It is mandatory both figures belong to the same Combat Group where they count as a single figure. A Doctor/ Engineer can have more than 1 Servant Remote, but he can only activate them one by one, applying the other rules considerations. Meanwhile, the other Remotes will be inactive. As they are activated by one single Order, the Doctor/ Engineer and the Remote will provide a single ARO to each figure with LoF to either or both of them. If they cross a Suppression Fire (SF) zone, both can receive shots from the shooter maintaining the SF. The Doctor/ Engineer and the Remote each get their own ARO in reaction to every Order declared in their LoF or inside their Zone of Control. These AROs must be the same for both figures, applying the Ghost: Synchronized rule.  The Doctor/ Engineer can see through the sensors and optical devices of his Remote, so he can react to any Order declared in LoF or ZC of his Remote with Alert, Change Facing, Dodging or with any Skill which does not require LoF to perform. The Servant Remote always disconnects automatically if the Doctor/ Engineer is out of the game table (Due to Airborne Deployment, Hidden Deployment, ...) or if he falls Unconscious or Dead. A disconnected Remote stands still and cannot receive Orders or perform AROs. An Immobilized (IMM) Marker must be placed beside the base of a disconnected Remote. The Remote connects automatically, without spending any Order or Short Skill, at the end of an Order in which the Doctor/ Engineer comes back from Unconscious state or enters the game table. Contrary to Ghost: Synchronized, there is no limit in the operating distance between the Servant Remote and its Doctor/ Engineer. Servant Remotes are Not Impetuous figures, so they cannot be activated with Impetuous Orders.  Remotes with Ghost: Servant which possess the Airborne Deployment (AD) Special Skill can be deployed by spending 1 Order from the Order Reserve or, if the player prefers, by using the same Order through which its Doctor/ Engineer is deployed, without requiring the spending of an additional Order. In such a situation, they must be deployed at the same time and from the same side of the game table, or using the same Circular Template, as their Doctor/ Engineer. Remotes with Ghost: Servant also have the G: Remote Presence Special Skill. Remotes with Ghost: Servant don't provide Victory Points to the enemy and are not counted as casualties for the Retreat! rule. If the Doctor/ Engineer is hacked (If he is liable to be hacked) or if he receives a hit from E/M Special Ammunition and fails his BTS roll, his Remote will disconnect automatically because its link is interrupted. The Remote will connect again at the end of the Order in which the Doctor/ Engineer is freed from the hacking or his equipment is repaired. A sepsitorized Doctor/ Engineer can use his Ghost: Servant in the normal way.	Electric Pulse

CH: TO Camouflage	The miniature possesses, besides the Special Skill Camouflage, a Thermo-Optical mimetizing device. This is a system that curves the light around its bearer, rendering him almost invisible and erasing his thermal signature. This sophisticated device also diffuses any possible atmospheric turbulence that its bearer may provoke and prevents his detection by radar or sonar. In game terms, TO Camouflage allows its possessor to perform the following:   Hidden Deployment: It allows the same type of deployment as CH: L-2 Camouflage, but there is no need to make use of a Marker. Provided that he does not move, the figure with CH: TO Camouflage will remain completely invisible. The player must take note of his figure's position in the most detailed possible way (Cover, Prone, etc.) so that the adversary will be able to verify the data in the moment in which he reveals his position. If the miniature moves, the player must place a TO Camouflage Marker, and show his adversary that he really was in that position from the beginning of the battle. If the figure performs any other action, he will have to be replaced by the miniature instead of the Marker. A miniature in Hidden Deployment does not add his Order to the Orders Reserve, as he is not on the game table. However, to carry out his first Order, which reveals his presence on the battlefield, he will not receive the Order from the Orders Reserve but will have to spend his own.   Camouflage in Movement: Allows the miniature to carry out the same Camouflaged Movement allowed by CH: Camouflage.   TO Defensive Camouflage: Allows the miniature the same Defensive Camouflage that CH: Camouflage provides, but a negative Modifier of -6 is applied if someone intends to attack him.

See Hacker combat rules for details. All Hacking Devices are Repeaters for the other Hackers of the same army. . The Hacking Device Plus has an additional advanced system of Localization-Identification-Liaison that works as a Forward Observer, but only within the Hacker's, or his Repeater's, Zone of Control (8 inches): LoF with the enemy is not required. In order to mark a target with the Hacker Device Plus Forward Observer function, it is necessary to spend an Order and pass a WIP Roll. The target can react by Dodging the marking of the Forward Observer Hacking Device Plus, provided he has LoF.	 AD: Combat Jump	Figures with this special jump equipment are trained to descend at full speed over the battlefield surprising enemies with devastating sudden attacks. The active player can deploy a miniature with AD: Combat Jump at any point during the battle. The figure spends 1 Order (His own, not one from the Orders Reserve) and makes a PH Normal Roll. If successful he deploys to any point on the table nominated by his owner, facing in any direction desired. Dispersion: If he fails the PH roll, the miniature suffers a detour in his fall, deviating as many inches as the Failure Category multiplied by 2.5 (FC x 2.5). In order to determine in which direction the miniature deviates, a Circular Template is used. Place the Circular Template on the target point where the miniature was supposed to land, with the number 1 facing towards the centre of the table. The second digit of the dice Roll is used indicate the direction in which the miniature deviate. If deviation prompts the figure to fall outside the battlefield, he will have to spend an extra Order from the Order Reserve to appear on the border of the game table at the point where he would have left. A figure cannot nominate as jump target the interior of a Smoke zone, or in Impassable Terrain or Zones of Low or Zero Visibility. The landing zone is of the same size as a Circular Template and must be free of scenery elements. The figure with Combat Jump can land on any point in the landing zone but the whole of its base must be in the interior of the Circular Template. A figure cannot land in base to base contact with another miniature. If a Coordinated Order is used to perform a Combat Jump, all the miniatures participating must choose the same template as their landing point. Those failing their PH Roll will be dispersed individually. Figures possessing Combat Jump can also deploy themselves, if they wish to, as if they possessed the preceding levels in AD.  Remotes with Combat Jump will have to perform a PH Roll in order to jump. PH determines the automation and programming level of their jumps.  Impetuous Figures with Combat Jump will have to use their Impetuous Order to perform their jump. If they do not want to jump immediately, at the beginning of the turn they must spend an Order from their army's Orders Reserve in order to stop each impetuous figure from deploying with their Impetuous Order.

Super-Jump	These miniatures are genetically, artificially, or evolutionarily designed to perform jumps of astonishing length and height. This Special Skill works automatically. It allows the miniature to move in a vertical, diagonal, or horizontal jump as many inches as indicated in his MOV, without having to make a PH Roll. Super-Jump is a Special Short Movement Skill that can be combined with other Short Skills. For example, with Super-Jump, the figure can shoot while flying through the air and this will be considered an Order of the Move+BS type. Also, when the miniature moves in a normal way he will be able to avoid any obstacle of his height or less without any Movement restriction. To calculate the Falling Damage taken by miniatures with SuperJump, the sum of both values of his MOV Attribute is subtracted from the distance and the result multiplied by 2.5. For example: a miniature with Super-Jump with MOV 4-4, that jumps from a terrace to the floor from a height of 10 inches will only have to make an ARM Roll against Damage 5 (distance of 10 minus MOV 4+4 = 2, multiplied by 2.5 to give 5).

Engineer is a Short Skill that allows, with a successful Normal WIP Roll, the repair of Structure points (STR) of vehicles or figures (1 point per successful WIP Roll) which he is in base contact with. If the Engineer fails his WIP Roll, the target miniature or structure loses 1 point of STR instead of recovering it.  Engineers can reactivate all weapons, equipment and armour affected by E/M and Adhesive Special Ammunition if they they pass 1 single Normal WIP Roll when in contact with the affected figure. If the Engineer fails the WIP Roll when reactivating, it is considered that the weapon or equipment is permanently shut down with no possibility of recovery.  It is essential that a miniature be in base to base contact with the item he wants to repair.  Figures that posses this Short Skill can also open locks, applying the same Modifiers as Hacking Security and Information (See Advanced Rules: Hacking). In order to open/close a door, base to base contact is required.  Engineer also allows Mines to be deactivated (Antipersonnel and Monofilament), as well as E/Maulers and D-Charges. In order to deactivate a Mine in a same Order, the figure has to come into its action radius (Circular Template) and pass a WIP Roll. If successful, the Mine does not explode and is defused. If the WIP roll is failed, then it explodes, affecting the Engineer as normal.  	 360 Visor	The miniature possesses a natural or artificial capacity of seeing his surroundings in 360.

A Forward Observer in LoF with an enemy will be able to mark him after passing a WIP roll (Face to Face, or Normal, depending on the case), modified by Covers, Distance, Camouflage and Hiding Special Skill, or an Optical Disruptor Device. Distance Modifiers for marking with Forward Observer are applied as per the following table: There are two types of attacks that can be made as a result of the marking by a Forward Observer:   Speculative: When the Forward Observer passes his WIP Roll, the target remains marked for any other comrade that wants to shoot at that target, and the Speculative Fire Modifier is not applied.   Guided: When the Forward Observer passes his WIP Roll the target will remain marked for any other comrade possessing a weapon with Guided Ammunition. This figure will be able to use the Short Skill Ballistic Skills to hit the marked miniature without a roll required, as the WIP Roll of the Observer substitutes.   A miniature marked by a Forward Observer will be considered as marked until the end of the turn of the player possessing the Observer that marked it. The special equipment of Forward Observers allows them to use the Flash Pulse.  	 360 Visor	The miniature possesses a natural or artificial capacity of seeing his surroundings in 360.

This level is only applicable in CC. Two figures with Martial Arts L3 will perform their First Attack at the same time, so they have to make a Face to Face Roll.  	 AD: Combat Jump	Figures with this special jump equipment are trained to descend at full speed over the battlefield surprising enemies with devastating sudden attacks. The active player can deploy a miniature with AD: Combat Jump at any point during the battle. The figure spends 1 Order (His own, not one from the Orders Reserve) and makes a PH Normal Roll. If successful he deploys to any point on the table nominated by his owner, facing in any direction desired. Dispersion: If he fails the PH roll, the miniature suffers a detour in his fall, deviating as many inches as the Failure Category multiplied by 2.5 (FC x 2.5). In order to determine in which direction the miniature deviates, a Circular Template is used. Place the Circular Template on the target point where the miniature was supposed to land, with the number 1 facing towards the centre of the table. The second digit of the dice Roll is used indicate the direction in which the miniature deviate. If deviation prompts the figure to fall outside the battlefield, he will have to spend an extra Order from the Order Reserve to appear on the border of the game table at the point where he would have left. A figure cannot nominate as jump target the interior of a Smoke zone, or in Impassable Terrain or Zones of Low or Zero Visibility. The landing zone is of the same size as a Circular Template and must be free of scenery elements. The figure with Combat Jump can land on any point in the landing zone but the whole of its base must be in the interior of the Circular Template. A figure cannot land in base to base contact with another miniature. If a Coordinated Order is used to perform a Combat Jump, all the miniatures participating must choose the same template as their landing point. Those failing their PH Roll will be dispersed individually. Figures possessing Combat Jump can also deploy themselves, if they wish to, as if they possessed the preceding levels in AD.  Remotes with Combat Jump will have to perform a PH Roll in order to jump. PH determines the automation and programming level of their jumps.  Impetuous Figures with Combat Jump will have to use their Impetuous Order to perform their jump. If they do not want to jump immediately, at the beginning of the turn they must spend an Order from their army's Orders Reserve in order to stop each impetuous figure from deploying with their Impetuous Order.
