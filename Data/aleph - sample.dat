The CC roll, usually a Face to Face one, becomes a Normal Roll for each combatant. Each makes their Skill Rolls, with a successful attack roll compelling the enemy to make an ARM Roll, so it is possible that both players receive Damage simultaneously. The Berserker receives a bonus of +9 to his CC Attribute in return, but never gains the +3 ARM Defence Bonus for making a successful CC Roll. If the opponent decides to Dodge, a success on his PH Roll will not avoid the blow, but he will be able to move out of CC. Berserk is an automatic Special Skill that does not require Orders to be spent for activation but its use must be declared at the same time as the declaration of a CC Skill use. The use of this Skill is optional and it can only be applied in CC.  	 Natural Born Warrior	A miniature which possesses this Special Skill is especially gifted in fighting, with a combat instinct highly developed through many hours of hard training and real encounters. This Special Skill nullifies all levels of Martial Arts in Close Combat, as well as the Berserk Special Skill of adversaries. Moreover, Natural Born Warrior gives the Special Skill V: Courage. This is an automatic Special Skill and it does not require the spending of any Orders or the making of any rolls to use it.	Combi Rifle (2)	Nanopulser	Pistol	EXP CCW
